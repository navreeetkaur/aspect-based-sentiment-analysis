# Aspect-Based-Sentiment-Analysis

## Problem to Solve

Reviews on review websites like Yelp and Zomato are accompanied by a subjective score which is often not sufficient to understand the review completely. Mining opinions from reviews about specific entities and their aspects can help consumers decide what to purchase and businesses to better monitor their reputation and understand the needs of the market. 
Our work aims to provide a framework to decompose the review score into various aspects and as- sign them individual scores, for which we aim to use a CNN model (from the [ACL'18 paper](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-2094)") with some modifications followed by clustering and sentiment analysis.

### Goal
To come up with such an aspect-sentiment table for a product:

## Model

Our model is implemented in two stages: 
(1) Aspect Extraction
(2) Aspect Categorization and Sentiment Analysis

Given a review, we summarize it by outputting polarities of particular fixed aspects. For example, for this review:
```Itâ€™s a nice place to relax and have conversation..But the food was okay, nothing great```, 
the model should output 
```{AMBIENCE: Positive, FOOD: Negative, SER- VICE: Neutral}```

## Environment

All code are tested under python 3.6.2 + pytorch 0.2.0_4

## Steps to Run Code 

Step 1: Download general embeddings (GloVe: http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip ), save it in data/embedding/gen.vec 

Step 2: Download Domain Embeddings (You can find the link under this paper's title in https://www.cs.uic.edu/~hxu/ ), save them in data/embedding

Step 3:
Download and install fastText (https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText) to fastText/

Step 4: 
Download official datasets to data/official_data/
Download official evaluation scripts to script/

We assume the following file names:

SemEval 2014 Laptop (http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task4/):
data/official_data/Laptops_Test_Data_PhaseA.xml
data/official_data/Laptops_Test_Gold.xml

SemEval 2016 Restaurant (http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task5/)
data/official_data/EN_REST_SB1_TEST.xml.A
data/official_data/EN_REST_SB1_TEST.xml.gold

### Improving SOTA of Aspect Detection

1. To improve quality of embeddings
- Using ELMO trained on the in-domain data to improve fastText embeddings

2. Architectural Changes
- Using LSTMs in the penultimate layer
    Loss decreasing, but f-1 score also decreasing
- Using GRU in final layer
    Similar results as the baseline model
- Using CRF instead of softmax
    Slightly worse performance
- Tried various pooling functions in the baseline CNN model

### Assigning Sentiment to Extracted Aspects

1. Aspect words - no inherent sentiment (e.g. pizza)
2. Have to look for the correct modifier words / sentence chunks (not always adjectival)
3. Came up with a rule-based system based on dependency parse trees 
4. Used vader sentiment
   Outputs a polarity score for sentence as a whole
   Eg: The pizza was good but the paneer sucked.

### Categorisation of Aspect words

- We used a concatenation of general-purpose and domain-specific embeddings and tried to cluster them using kmeans, dbscan, optics
- Tried semi-supervised clustering by providing seeds to kmeans
- For aspects that were phrases:
    Tried max, sum, avg of constituent word vectors
    Tried normalizing the word vectors

Evaluation Metric: Qualitative observation of the clusters

Observations:
- Sum -> caused clustering together of longer aspects
- Avg -> reduced cluster quality 
- Normalizing and element-wise max of embeddings improved cluster quality

### Visualizing the formed clusters - tSNE plot
