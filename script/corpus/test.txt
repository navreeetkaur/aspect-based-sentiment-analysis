The only reason why I would venture into the Desert Passage shops at Aladdin.  They carry the largest assortment of BCBGirls clothing.  Of course, they also carry the pricier collection, BCBG.  I love their wide range of price points. Good eats and good peeps! The Reuben was awesome and the service was great. Better than the big chain bagel places for sure! Ok so last time I went they nailed all the dishes-except maybe that weird parmigiano-sour chicken wing dish- not a fan but I was very impressed especially since the last two visits food was uneventful- I think they got new kitchen crew so that's a good thing now This place creates excellent food. I have been here a handful of times and have no complaints. The meatballs are homemade, you can taste it. The bread is fresh and the customer service is amazing.  I would recommend this place to anyone!!! Alvin, the manager, what a word I can't say. Arrogant, unprofessional, and ignorant. I ordered from grub hub and online they have spicy garlic listed as a dry rub. It came as a sauce. When I asked him the difference between a rub and a sauce he said I'm not going to answer any questions. Alvin stated this was grub hubs mistake even though they are a third party delivery service. He also changed the name of the smart mouthed hostess from Sabrina to brandy. I was advised to contact grub hub in regards to the confusion. Alvin was also rude to that employee stating he would not be doing anything to address the misconception. I was not looking for a freebie. I wanted them to correct their misleading menu. Will be going to corporate asap...never going to hooters again. I was shocked that a half of southwest chicken salad was $6.00. I realize at the airport you typically pay more but I found this a big rip off.  Not to mention it was not big at all. It was worth perhaps $4.00 total These posers don't allow dogs on their patio. Way to turn away customers! Suck it nerds!! NationsChoice offered the lowest rate on BankRate, but after reading several negative reviews I was skeptical. Joe Garza said he could get my refi done in 30 days and he did it, even after a low appraisal. The entire process was smooth and painless. Joe and Michael Clouatre were extremely efficient, responsive, and professional. I would definitely recommend them to my friends and family. I need to begin this review by stating: I hate Brussel sprouts.  As a child, my father would serve them to my brothers and I, but we did whatever we could to avoid them... hunger strikes at the dinner table, temper-tantrums, or simply slipping them into a napkin and pretend to have finished our meal.    As I grew older, I was open to trying them again since my taste buds evolved to enjoy vegetables like broccoli and beets.  Unfortunately, Brussel sprouts left me wanting to scrub my tongue with a toothbrush and mouthwash in order to rid my mouth of the flavor.  When ordering at Dorothy 6, I saw that Brussel sprouts were serves as a side to most dishes.  My burger came with fries, but my boyfriend's meal came with a side of Brussel sprouts.  My burger was simply perfect - juicy, pink, and filled with flavor.  I couldn't have asked for anything better.  Perhaps that's what made me feel adventurous... I grabbed my fork and sampled my boyfriend's Brussel sprouts... I was in love!  How could this be?  My entire life I have despised Brussel sprouts.  The thought of them would make me gag in horror.  Now after trying the sprouts served at Dorothy 6, I crave them!  Where have they been all my life?!    I would go back to Dorothy 6 Blast Furnace Cafe for many reasons: great beer, amazing burgers, pierogis... Now Brussel sprouts are added to that list.  Thank you, Dorothy 6 for changing my mind and mouth about Brussel sprouts. The food was good but overall I would suggest finding somewhere else. The service was a little slow, the food was alright but not amazing (and we are in Phoenix, don't settle for mediocre). It felt like a chain restaurant.  On the upside, it might be good for large groups. How can you not love Trader Joe's? Everyone is eager to help and answer any questions that you may have. The prices on their produce is great. My family and I truly believe that their fried mozzarella sticks are some of the best around. I know that parking is always hit or miss, but that doesn't keep me from shopping there weekly. Their prices are pretty hard to beat! This place is garbage now and it upsets me because it used to be my favorite place in town to get a good pizza. The new owners lowered the quality and taste of the pizza, they even use canned sauce and frozen dough unlike the previous owners who would make their sauce. I never write reviews but this needed to be said. How much do I have to pay to get the old owners and pizza back! Ordered a single KYB AGX strut from Vivid. They had the best price shipped to CA  online so I thought I'd give them a try. There was a minor problem with my paypal account but Vivid was quick to email me about it and also quick to fix the problem. Item arrived promptly and in good condition. Very satisfied with their service and communication. Would not hesitate to order from them again. This is my "go to" spa in Las Vegas! My husband and I are spa fanatics and have been to a multitude of spas in LV, and although some spas are hit or miss, Green Valley Ranch never disappoints.   Pros: 1. We've never really had an issue booking appts, even when calling same day (always a plus, since we are not good at planning ahead) 2. We've had a ton of different massage therapists, and they are always great!  3. There are multiple co-ed areas  (outdoor pool/jacuzzi area, inside hot tub, outdoor fireside lounge area) 4. No matter when we've been there, the spa never seems overcrowded or busy 5. 20% locals discount  6. If you have kids, Green Valley Ranch now has a Kids Quest (super fun daycare facilities) that you can drop them off at! (score!!!)  Cons: Honestly can not think of anything wrong with this spa! Had an egglslut and a gaucho... pretty good for brunch but not enough to fill.  Also had to wait in line for 30 minutes-- should've gotten there earlier, oh well!  A good mid morning snack. The best Yucatan Pork (aka cochinita pibil) I have ever had! It was so tender and full of flavor, it melts in your mouth! Order it with corn tortillas and makes excellent tacos! One word, YUMMY! I love Marie Callender's and this one didn't disappoint me.  The service was very quick and super friendly.   The food is great and the portions are good.   Eating here is always a good value and here it was a good experience. I was expecting a lot more for what they charge. The buffet wasn't any better than others on the strip. Station casinos still give you the most bang for your buck. If ambience ID what your after than this is your place Love the store but I did notice they are out of many things . The girl working really had no idea about anything hair color and tool related. I asked her what is their best selling lightweight blow dryer and she basically just told me to look for any box that said lightweight. When it came to color I was trying to ask her if they carried a certain line and she didn't even know what I was talking about or anything about the product. I asked if it needed a special developer since it was a color line I don't normally use and she was lost. I feel like cosmoprof needs to better train their employees to know their products and have some motivation to sell ! My review is very similar to that of Casey Lyn B: I am American, have rarely had poutine, and this is the only poutine place I've ever been to in Canada. It is, in fact, the only restaurant I have ever been to in Canada (went during a 6-hr Toronto layover), but the bacon+chive poutine was just perfect and everything I wanted. I liked all the components: the fries themselves, the gravy, the cheese curds, and the bacon (it was NOT Canadian bacon but American bacon bits). The name might make it seem like a tourist trap but from looking at the setup, I think it's meant for drunks hungry at 2am. If I lived in Toronto and was drunk at 2am, I would DEFINITELY seek this place out, but I also recommend it to sober tourists on a layover! I was looking forward to trying Darbar restaurant. Went there for lunch few days ago for the first time. We were greeted and welcomed. Then I asked for some water but was brought bottle water and was told that "the tap water was not healthy due to construction"! Really?! That was the weirdest thing I had ever heard!  We were brought some bread which was not very impressive compared to North restaurant or Gilaneh restaurant that bring hot freshly made delicious bread! Then looking at the menu, the first thing I noticed was the high prices, which I think was the highest I had ever seen in a Persian restaurant. Looks like the prices have gone up about 1.5 times since it was opened 2 years ago, based on the menu I found online. To be fair, the portion was big and 2 people with average appetite can share it. I had Soltani kebab and the quality was very good. I just think that at least for lunch the prices need to be more reasonable. They could make the portions less I guess and bring the price down too. Overall I am happy I tried it but don't think I will go there too often. If I had to describe this place in one word, it would be 'meh'. This place is surrounded by big commercial buildings, and I would think this  would be a good place for lunch for the employees. Also there's not many other pho places around here so I see why this place would get a lot of business. Came here craving for pho, I left kinda half satisfied. The broth was a bit too light for me, the portions were quite average, they didn't have culantro with their complimentary veggies nor my fav pickled hot peppers. The condensed milk coffee wasn't filtered properly so I had to avoid drinking all the way to the bottom of the cup. 6.5/10 Place looks pretty cool  barbers are friendly have never gotten a cut from here I have only been going for product  but am planning on going one day soon This pizza seriously reminds me of Pizza Hut.  I thought it while I was eating it, and then when I brought extras to work the next day, my coworkers were all "who got Pizza Hut!?"  It has that nostalgic taste, that buttery pan-crust, that takes you back to your childhood of ordering from chain pizza restaurants.    I didn't pay for it, but apparently it's extremely cheap.  And thus - really popular!  We stopped in on a Tuesday night, and I believe it was $6 for unlimited toppings on a "large pizza" which is really a smallish medium pizza at any other place, but whatever.  They can call it what they like.  There was a LONG line of people waiting to pick up their order, so clearly Pizza Bogo has hit a niche with the public.  It was good - tasty, crispy crust, decent toppings, but it's not worth freaking out over.  "Best Gourmet Pizza in America?"  Furreal?  Says who?  I've had way better pizza, all over the country, but I will admit for the price and the convenience (and the nostalgic Pizza Hut esque taste), it's a good deal.  I'd say it's good for the days when you just want to get a couple of boxes of good pizza to eat during a game or something. So my Wife and I along with my son stopped in for two meals while we were staying at the Linq Hotel.  Dinner.  We all had a great Time the service was great the food was great, Wife and I both had the Cesar Salad I added Chicken the wife did not.  I added a wing order plain with both sauces on the side,  another great choice! My son ordered the volcano fries I believe.  They were a little spicy for him but I had one and they were also very good.    Experience #1 "4 Stars"  Breakfast the next Morning:  Being we had such a good experience the night before we decided we should try breakfast.  WOW did things change.  The only part of this experience that was favorable was the Hostesses!  They met you without delay and were extremely polite.  From Mount Everest to Death Valley from there.  We sat down and waited a while for our server "Eric" to arrive.  When he did he looked alike he had just gotten out of bed, and acted like we were wasting his time.  We ordered three things.    1.  Steak and Eggs which definitely missed their stop on Flavor Town, Extremely Bland!  Cooked well but again very bland.    2.  Chilaquiles.  Looked like it sat under a heat lamp too long and again other that the carne Asada which did taste ok we were not a fan.  3.  Chicken fried Bacon biscuits and Gravy.  The gravy was obviously prepared by someone different the the cook that prepared the Bacon which was just above Raw.  Remember the Gravy?  Outstanding, However that was the only part of the dish that was going to be eaten by my son.  This dish should be changed to just Biscuits and Gravy!    Let me make a note that if it was not for the hostess and the guy bringing by the coffee I would have given breakfast 0 stars. However I am giving breakfast 2 stars for the things that were good.    Also if you read the reviews it is obvious that Guy and his staff have written this place off as a lost cause because I cannot even see where they have replied to any of the reviews they have received.  Good or Bad.  Experience #2. 2 Stars.  Over all we give Guys a very charitable 3 stars.   Lastly the Hash House must be where Guy eats when he is in town.  They waiter stated that he had been there for a while and that Guy doesn't even stop buy when he is in town.    We did try the Hash House A GO Go and it was great. Long wait but well worth it!!!!!! I am going to give it 5 stars cause I want it to succeed. It's a beautiful restaurant and the food was good and the pickles were insane! Try it and support it, after-all the place is legendary! I would give these ladies a 10 if I could! I consider myself a good cleaner but when we have them come monthly the job they do is MAGICAL - I get giddy when I walk into our home and see how beautiful it looks. Attention to detail is an understatement - it almost looks like new faucets and knobs are installed each time they come. They did our two bedroom two bath in under two hours and are so sweet. They take "clean" to a whole new level. I LOVE THEM! Jenny is a miracle worker!!!!! I had a very bad color done at another salon. I didn't know how much she would be able to fix it. She stayed late n made sure I left happy. Best color I have ever had done!! See Jenny for your color it will be the best decision you could ever make for your hair!!! Food was great. Amazing beer selection. Tonight was our first time here and we will definitely be back. The kitchen manager came out and asked us how the food was, and it's just so nice to have that personal touch now. Gameplay is fun but horribly disorganized facility.  Bartenders are slow. We could have had 2 drinks before they even took our order.  No reservations taken unless you pay 50 dollars to skip queue, which we only found out late.   Half the bays were open yet we were made to wait 2 and a half hours, after which we left.  Drinks were good, once we got them, food was decent except for the chips, which were disgusting. Like Doritos without flavoring.  Music was awful.  Typical Scottsdale douche baggery, except with no sense of business and lame customer service.  Prices are also on the high end making the experience even worse. After a month of searching crappy places, Internet sales, tent events, awkward warehouses, my boyfriend and I came across this places as we were tossing up the white flag on our way to Ikea. It's clean, straight forward, and Chuck our sales guy was super helpful and not pushy. While they do have discounted and clearance mattresses they are the only ones I've found that give a 10 year warranty AND a 30 day comfort trial period on all their mattresses. How rad is that? I'd totally recommend them to anyone. :) thanks guys for making this so easy, wish we came here first! This is a home reno supply store, similar to a Home Depot in the middle of Little Portugal. But unlike Home Depot's gaudy orange and grey monstrosities of warehouses, this supply store is jam packed with aisles brimming with essentials. Walking around, it's like you're in a maze with more cool stuff waiting around the next corner. They have sections devoted to different aspects of building things with staff on hand to answer questions. The check out counter is well staffed and right by the entrance making it easy to park right in front on Ossington, jump in the store and quickly dash away. What is super impressive is their bathroom piece selection. Upstairs they have a showroom with modern freestanding bathtubs and fancy showerheads and kitchen sinks lined up showcasing beautiful design. If anyone knows ceramic tile, the Portuguese know it better than anyone. The selection is fantastic! The mecca in the GTA is Olympic tile, but after going thru Olympic, Downtown Lumber won out with its tight selection of choice tile designs and helpful staff. There is even free customer parking right behind the store where a tight laneway leads you to almost valet style parking, very nice! When your order for lumber, cement, or tile is filled at the service counter in the store, you take the invoice down the back laneway where the warehouse is tucked away. After a couple visits I was most impressed how the guy back there immediately came out to fill my order after driving into the tight spot. And he even loaded up the heavy tile into the car (they also deliver!). Super service from some incredible and dedicated people. Thumbs up Downtown Lumber! Well what can I say.  The owners are very nice and try.  I think the wife should do more then seat people.  She could pass food around while the husband cooks diff meats.  They use like four of the same meats but say their different, for example adding garlic sauce on it counts as one.  Wine comes with the Groupon, however if you don't want it, you only get one soda.     I started feeling sick before I left and believe I have food poising.  I've been gone less then 25 mins and been in the bathroom three times already.      The meats are cooked on the grill not like Texas de Brazil when they have all the meats cooking on a rotational cooker.   I would try it.  Spend they extra 10 and go to Texas de Brazil..    I wanted to like this place, I did.. oops back to bathroom!! I loved my pulled pork sandwich. It was very very good ! they have a spicy vinegar sauce, Carolina style which I really appreciate . However I always eat my pulled pork with coleslaw. I ordered Carolina style.... It was horrible! I had a half inch of vinegar floating at the bottom of my cup. Totally turned me off. However there are several other side  dishes. I  know what to not try again, but I certainly will come back here. The barbecue was phenomenal. Chenin did the braces for both of my boys, and they loved it there. The doctors are amazing, the office staff is friendly & makes you feel like family. The waiting room is fun and inviting for kids of all ages. And that's not even counting the amazing work they did on their teeth! My youngest Josh started the process with a head gear, in 2009 I think it was, and just finished his Invisalign and his teeth look amazing! My oldest was 19 when he started his, it's definitely a place for kids of all ages. So If you are looking for a place for braces for your kids or even for yourself definitely check out Chenin Orthodontics! Exceptional in food quality, taste and ambience.   The Dinner-  Moscow Mule-Plenty of vodka, spiced with candied ginger and lime.   Appetizer- Cheese and Meat Assortment; Venison, Prosciutto, goat and cow cheese options.   The half chicken with honey truffle sauce- Light yet robust, with ''Mac and Cheese'  Dessert- Lemon Cheesecake, Spiced Pumpkin Brulee and Tiramisu Cappuccino.   The Lemon citrus notes blended perfect with the cheesecake creating a noticeable and pleasant accent with the creamy texture of cheesecake.   Tiramisu Cappuccino- Thick whipped texture. Very Rich. I recommend sharing.   Spiced Pumpkin Brulee- Solid dependable Crème' Brulee.  The service was attentive and the ambience is unique and tasteful.   Vintner Grill was difficult to find hidden inside an office suite complex. Trust your map. Its tucked away right off the main road. Experience was enjoyable and the food memorable. AMAZING!!!! So so so so so good!! My mom, sister, and I stopped in before we saw a show and all loved our orders. I played it a little safe and got the spaghetti, my sister got the lasagna, and my mom got the burrata agnolotti. We all loved our meals and ate every single bite. The sauce for the spaghetti was so rich and flavorful and although I didn't try their selections my sister claimed it was the best lasagna she's ever tried. It is a little pricey but it's so worth it for the quality of the food and the great service. A must try if you're in Vegas! I NEVER eat at Extreme Pita. After a bout of food poisoning many, many years ago...I have been so turned off by it. However, while visiting with my sister over the weekend we figured we should have a quick bite to eat before venturing out on our errands. We stopped in here as it was close by, and I was super impressed! We were greeted with friendly smiles. The place was SPOTLESS, including the bathroom, which I did use. We shared a veggie pita and it was really good, all of the ingredients tasted fresh and delicious. The only downside was the really strong onion smell on my hands after washing them repeatedly! I am happy to say that I am no longer afraid of Extreme Pita =) When the power steering pump went out on our 2005 BMW 325i one Friday evening, we needed to find someone to repair it asap. Unfortunately 99% of the mechanics that specialize in BMW's were closed on the weekend. We hestitatly brought it into the dealership and was quoted over a grand for the repair. It was too much for our budget. Thankfully for us, we called around and stumbled upon Arthur and his shop. He quoted us HALF of what the dealership would've charged us. Not only was it the best deal in town, Arthur was super knowledgable, honest, friendly, and accommodating to our needs. We needed the car back by Monday so he was able to order the parts on Saturday, came in on his day off on Sunday to repair it, and had it ready for us first thing Monday morning. Super impressed with his work and customer service. He was honest and didn't try to up-sell any extra unneccessary services, which we deeply appreciated. We highly recommend and will definitely be a returning customer. Thank you Arthur! If I still lived here I would be a Fanatic about these!  This is my first "Food Cart/truck" kind of experience and review!  How Embarrassing!  The One Guy I met Friday -South End - I liked very much!  Like others you have to look at their website to find out where and when!  This is Cool in a way!  Grapefruit Hibiscus!  Very Good!  Mostly Grapefruit with a hint of Hibiscus!  Perfect Balance!   Pineapple Habanero!  Perfekt!  Hotter than you may expect though plenty Cool! Sadly, you have need to come here unless you have a specific reason to be here, or you like looking at abandon shops inside of a small mall.  There are a handful of stores inside and a school- you know your mall is failing when it becomes a church or a school. There are a few bars, but nothing major. Again, I feel like only people staying at the hotel next to it would visit here only because it's so close.  Now there are a few other restaurants outside of the mall like The Hard Rock Cafe and Texas De Brazil, but nothing really catches your eye as a place you really want to stop at.  The Ducky Tour begins and ends there so there is that. What's sad is the area itself is kind of nice. They installed that beautiful fountain that plays to music, like the Belliago in Vegas, but with much less flare.  It's upsetting because this could be an amazing place, but it just isn't. You don't need to come here if you're visiting, spend your time at more interesting places because there are a ton in the city. My boyfriend and I were excited to try this restaurant because it is very close to where we live. We were hungry for a late dinner and ordered some food to go to bring back home. The food was ready in about 15 minutes and everything was great!   We are mostly veggie eaters so we each tried the falafel wrap, which was excellent. The falafel was crispy and warm, grilled with veggies in a pita wrap. The wraps came with a fresh cucumber sauce that we put on the wraps, a great addition. We tried the tabouli, which was also fresh and delicious. We also shared a spinach + feta pie from the appetizer section.   This was a LOT of fresh food for a great price, we will definitely be going back. Highly recommended. I saw the Titanic Exhibit here on a Saturday morning. It was a fantastic experience which I highly recommend for everyone. But as we walked through it, and especially as I saw all the wide-eyed kids captivated by what they were seeing, it saddened me that a huge number of Phoenician families simply can't afford the tickets. $20 for adults, $15 for kids as young as 3. Do they really need to charge 15 bucks for a 3 or 4 year old to see this with parents? Come on. The exhibit took us about 90 minutes to complete. I'm docking two stars just because of the price, which is shameful for a so-called nonprofit to be charging the public.   Price aside, the exhibit is wonderful. It's in Phoenix until May 4, 2008. To avoid standing in line, I recommend buying tickets on-line as we did, though there is a fee for that.   You start off by being handed a somewhat cheesy "ticket" of one actual passenger who traveled on the Titanic, with some basic information about him or her. The exhibit wants to put you in the actual shoes of that person as you walk through, which I thought was effective. Only at the end of the exhibit do you find out whether your passenger survived the sinking or not.   I chuckled at the passenger I was assigned to, who was a prominent Frenchman traveling to Montreal, Quebec for the purpose of designing a bust of the then Prime Minister of Canada, Sir Wilfred Laurier. Of course I felt a personal connection to Monsieur Chevre, as a former Canadian Prime Minister and Montrealer myself. My companion was assigned a 21-year old Englishwoman who had bought a 2nd class ticket, and was traveling with family to New York for her wedding to an American.   The exhibit is designed to be a comprehensive lesson on the Titanic. It sheds light on how artifacts were discovered and retrieved from the ocean, the design and building of the ship, what the interior rooms looked like for 1st class and 3rd class passengers, lifestyle and daily routines on the deck, and finally the collision with an iceberg and sinking of the ship. Over 1500 dead, out of over 2000.   Hundreds of artifacts are on display, from personal items, to fine cutlery, to a door taken from the ship. The one that struck me the most was an old uniform top that still had its owner's faded name, "Broom", on it. Mr Broom was a first class steward who perished with the ship. All of the artifacts bring to life a snapshot of the world as it was in April of 1912. Even if you're not interested in the Titanic itself (and I am not), anyone who enjoys history would enjoy this.   There was a guy dressed up as a passenger there who, to my amazement, either had an incredibly impressive fake Irish accent (and I fancy myself as pretty good at detecting fake accents), or he was actually an Irishman. I decided not to ask him directly because answering me would require him to step out of character. He was somewhat knowledgeable about the ship, as I found out by asking him about the decision to have only 20 lifeboats instead of the 32 that could have saved every passenger on board. The cut was essentially made for the sake of having a nice view from the deck. Nice work, ship designers.   I will say that the analytical lawyer side of me was slightly disappointed by not seeing much that focused on the factors that caused the ship to hit an iceberg and sink. There are exhibits telling the basic story, but I was left wanting just a bit more. Still, by the time we reached the end and excitedly looked up our Frenchman and Englishwoman on the manifest to see if they lived or died, we were delighted to have finally seen this exhibit. We cracked up as we saw one 8 year old girl ironically complain to her mommy that "her" passenger died even though he was "really really rich".   Monsieur Chevre and the young Englishwoman, it turns out, both lived. I used this company and Joey an employee was amazing and quick cleaner. They left the windows  crystal clear. My landlord was so happy This place sucks sucks sucks. My refrigerator leaks on the inside over all of my food and leaks on the outside all over the kitchen floor. They say they have 24 hour maintenance and they will not show up outside of regular working hours. They have an answering service that takes a message and they don't get back to you the next day. You still have to call again. They came into my house rearranged things to get to a valve and did not put anything they moved back. When I asked if they were going to, they rudely rolled their eyes and said, "probably not." The women in the office are rude overall. They are rude when I ask for my packages, as though it's such a pain for them to get up and get them. They are stuck up and fake. The pool is so cold I can't stand being in it for one second. No one picks up their dog feces. They never have bags for people to pick up their dog feces because one person steals them all for themselves and the lazy ass office bitches refuse to fill it up even though one of them works every day. You hear random dogs barking all day. It NEVER stops. You hear dogs barking from the ghetto behind the building too. People from the neighborhood break-in and use the pool and work out room. It is such a high crime area, there is no way to safely take a walk without being mugged. The work out room is so small that it's hard to get a machine because of the people from the hood next door using the facilities. There is no where to recycle and you can bet I got a rude answer when I asked if there was one. There is no outgoing mailbox. You can leave your mail on a table in the office and hope no one steals it. However, that entails looking at the 3 wise bitches in the office. The maintenance man is nice, but obviously overworked from the crappy buildings he has to service. He looks suicidal every time I see him. A fire broke out and burned 3 apartments because of faulty wiring (which means any of ours could go next). Just when you think your silence about all of the issues going on here has paid off, they increased rent over $100 to renew my neighbors lease. Then they tell him that he has to give them 2 months notice when he was paying month to month. I do not want to get into the poor construction. It has the usual thin walls and difficult to clean surfaces. You can hear everything from your neighbors having sex to the bass from their music. There is no parking at all. Just your car and another one behind you. There is maybe 5 spots inside the gate and everyone else has to walk a country mile to get to your apt. There is no grass for your dog to run. Just some feces-filled gravel for them to get diseases off of. Great little park...however the Chinese/Japanese takes it over every morning for the daily exercise....not appropriate for them alone... Bought a used 2012 Mazda Speed 3 from this dealer today. I traded in my car as well. The dealership overall I am giving 4 stars, I would give Matt, my salesman, 5 stars for him alone.   I found the vehicle online after several days of searching for the right car to trade mine in for. I called and made an appointment to test drive the vehicle. I arrived early but was greeted and offered refreshment immediately. Really loved the vehicle and started negotiating. Basically told them what I wanted and could do and they met me exactly there without any issue. They also gave me more for my trade in than anyone else had offered. It took a long time to get with the finance manager and that part was the only real detractor from the experience.   I did notice the typical extra items they could have tried to tack on and it sounds like from other reviews they sometimes try to add that stuff on, but if you give them the bottom line and have confidence knowing what you need in your vehicle, probably won't be a problem.  I highly recommend this dealer. Sat at the bar and the bar tender introduced me to a new drink that I love! I have never liked beer, but he made me a "Shandy" (Stella Beer and Sprite mixed together). I am now a shandy lover. We came here twice during our stay.   Why? Because of the beef noodle soup. Tired, hungry, slightly hungover, and wanting something to satisfy the need of something homey that American food cannot, Noodle Asia was the most appropriate dining opportunity. Plus it was just downstairs in the lobby at the Venetian.  Shitty service, but it didn't matter when we got our bowls. The waitress took our orders and requests, but that was it . We had to ask other waitresses. POP was just what I needed on the first 3 digit day in Vegas yesterday! Situated in the corner of a large strip mall on Fort Apache, I was across the street for a lash appointment and decided to make a pit stop at Hobby Lobby. Felt parched and walked into Pop thinking it was a bubble tea joint, nope definitely not that - as the name implies it's pop for my midwesterners. Not just any old pop, speciality drinks made with pop.   Such a simple concept honestly, but very well thought out and executed. I'm not much of a pop drinker, after all I counsel against it. But every once in a while I'll give myself the option, luckily it's not something I crave. Initially it was the feeling that I had walked into the place assuming it was something else but felt odd walking out. I got to looking at the menu and looking back outside at the sun beaming down and thought I'd give it a whirl. Have to say, I will be back!  Soda is used as a base ingredient to craft a drink. So if you create your own you choose a size, pick your soda (or tea for my healthies), pick your add ins. I appreciate that they have an XS size which for me was truly a S. Great for portion control people! Then they have a menu with fool proof recipes created for us. I chose the Jojo because I enjoy Dr. Pepper and substituted the coconut cream for vanilla cream. Yum! They also have a secret menu (see picture - white) of drink creations and needless to say I was overwhelmed with options. Finally, they have a foods fo pair alongside your beverages, popcorn and cookies. A kids menu per say - an XXS drink (12 oz) with kid size popcorn. Also, got beverages, coffee/hot chocolate.   Aside from my beverage being delicious, I appreciated the service. It's a very simple concept so to speak, so the fact that the employee took his time to talk me through the menu was above and beyond. The pricing was right! The shop has ample seating, parking. You get a stamp card for return visits. I wasn't told explicitly about a guarantee but I'm sure my drink would've been remade had I not liked it.   I was told they have another location, Silverado Ranch. Will most definitely be going back and recommending on a hot, hot day! For the average person, it's hard finding a good automotive shop to take care of your precious vehicle. Jesus, Mat, James and the rest of the guys here at Just Brakes took me in immediately as a walk in and made quick  work of what I needed done on my car. Initially, I was trying to make the most of my day off and didn't have a lot of time to wait around. Jesus insisted that he could get it done on the spot. I needed a simple alignment but what I received was far more then that. All of the guys here brought me to the back of the store and gave me a couple burgers while I waited, being that it was Super Saturday where their vendors treat them to a meal of their choosing. They treated me like family and their dedication to making the customer happy will bring me back here every time I need work done. From struts and shocks,  to oil changes and tire rotations. This is the place I'll be taking my vehicle to. Ive always liked there deals specially pre roll deal but lately they have not been great other than that nice staffing always. We took our grandmother here for a going away dinner before she moved to a different city, sadly it was not what we came to expect from red lobster.  The air conditioner was cranked to the max and it was a chilly day to begin with , so when our food finally arrived it was cold before we got to taste it. We had ordered endless shrimp and after our first round of shrimp we waited for our waiter to return for over 15 minutes , and after we ordered the second shrimp selection they didn't make it to our table for another 20 minutes and after the rest of us had finished our entire meals .  We then asked for the bill and when we finally got it the waiter didn't return to cash us out. We actually had to walk to the front to pay .  We asked the manager to speak about our service and he told us to wait a moment and he would be right back , but never returned .  Service at its finest .... lol Good food, inexpensive prices. Pretty decent amount of different Italian foods that should satisfy most tastes. The restaurant is a little on the noisy side however if you are willing to see past that and have a family, I suggest trying it out. With most (if not all) pasta dishes, you can opt for the 'family size' which is a great way of cutting costs and sharing a meal. Pizza's are gigantic too (made in their wood burning stove).  Not quite on the same level as some places you would find in Little Italy, but for a chain restaurant, it is certainly worthy of 3 stars. It was much better before, but I noticed the quality of food was declining while the price of food was increasing. It would be a good idea if try to out compete their competitors who also offer Mediterranean cuisine by atleast lowering the price since the options aren't as many as well as the quality and service. I've been to Snug on numerous occasions, and I do enjoy my time when I go! However, I believe that the menu does need an update. For the prices they are serving, and the beautiful location, the food is not on par. The crab cakes are amazing, and I've had my fair share of fish, steak, ahi tuna, good but not amazing.   Come for a good meal and beautiful location, but after being there many times, menu needs an update! I hope the chefs see this! Hope they are not cutting corners. Large portions. Great bread sticks. Chicken parmesan was top quality. Everything was just perfect. This is worth the money and our time to drive! Recommend this place to everyone! *drools* It was okay. The people were really nice and friendly. My boyfriend and I went together, and I decided just to get rice and naan because I wasn't very hungry, but my boyfriend was quite hungry so he got a dinner. He got the "tikka" kabob plate. Each dinner plate comes with naan, salad, and rice.   My boyfriend loved his kabob, and I tried it and it was pretty good. The rice was kind of greasy and there was not much taste. The only thing that made the food different from other middle-east style eateries was the salad dressing which my boyfriend thought tasted like Big Mac sauce, and this other sauce for the meat that he said tasted kind of like salsa (not that it was bad, just saying).  The actual venue was extremely busy; we went at about 8pm on a Saturday night. There was a lot of tables in the restaurant but they were all full. A varied mix of people; families with children, groups of friends, couples... everyone. We decided to get takeout because really hectic restaurants are uncomfortable to me.  I would not go out of my way again for a meal here, but if I happen to be in the area and I am hungry, I would probably go for some naan or something. The people were very  nice, and I like to support nice people! :) After spending the day at Woodbine Beach, I was looking for a good burrito place within decent walking distance to share with friends. Luckily, Burrito Bandidos was not too far a walk, and it certainly did not disappoint.   I ordered a large Mango Chicken burrito, complete with everything, short of jalapenos. I waited around 5 minutes for the order to be completed, which seemed shorter than most of the reviews here. (Although, most of them seem outdated.) The chicken was fairly juicy and tender, and the ingredients tasted fresh. My only complaint would be that the mango chicken was around a dollar more than the regular chicken, and the only thing you got were roughly julienne-d apple mango slices. Nice, tangy addition, but not worth the extra cost in my opinion.   I would drop by again if I was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return. 4/5 We visited last week.  Be Warned! My husband's sister ordered a cheeseburger.  The waiter asked how she wanted it cooked and explained that "Medium" would be pink through-out.  She ordered the burger medium.  It took a very long time for our food to arrive and when it did, her burger was cooked very well done.  The waiter offered to have another burger made.  We had waited quite a while, and everyone was nearly done with their meals, all of us sharing with my sister-in-law whom still had no burger.  The waiter came by and my sister-in-law said to just cancel the order because we had already waited too long for it.  He said that he would take care of it.  A few minutes later, someone who appeared to be a manager came to the table delivering the burger we had already asked to be removed from the order.  My sister in law, frustrated at this point stated "No, I don't want it now".  The manager walked away.  A few minutes later I noticed the manager with a waiter standing in the middle of the restaurant pointing at our table and mocking my sister-in-law like a school yard bully.  I very discreetly informed our waiter that I thought it was highly inappropriate for his manager to behave in such a way.  Moments later the manager stormed up to our table and began raising his voice at me and scolding me for my "perception" about what had taken place.  He then went on to blame the whole incident on the waiter, who had done nothing wrong.  I won't be back. Good food we go once a week close to the best in the valley! Really good beef pho also the lemon grass chicken is awesome!! I was quite surprised by my visit to Adega. We had a reservation for 8:15 but showed up around 7:30 and they told us our table was waiting for us. Their tables are quite distant from each other, so you can actually listen to what your friends are saying 5 stars so far! After we made our order we got bread and olives, which is typical for Portuguese restaurants I guess. I don't go to too many, so I'm not an expert. Bread was okay, but kind of generic. 3 stars for that Food was another matter. We ordered the appetizer platter and some shrimp on the side. Everything was really good, and tasty. Their portions aren't even small, cause I felt  I was getting full by the time we finished the appetizers. For main dish we all tried something different - seafood and meat. If you go there go for the seafood! My duck breast was tasty, but the portion felt small. My meal was the smallest of all. I didn't leave hungry so it didn't bother me. Overall, I'd say food is really delicious, but not so imaginative. I felt like you can have some of the dishes at other places. 4* here Desert: I ordered the creme caramel and everyone tried it. Everyone got wowed by it! I haven't tried creme caramel in a long time, but it was definitely what you should order if you ever visit 5* on that Service: attentive and polite. Not much else to say. I have no remarks! The waiter was a really nice guy. This could be considered both good and bad, but I felt we had to wait too long to get our main dishes. I didn't care cause we were already having a good time, but for someone who's in a hurry it might be a problem 4.5 stars on service  Tried the Portuguese beer which was nice, but expensive.   To sum it up, while the place might not be exactly 5 stars if I have to be more objective. My score reflects my overall experience from dining in there.  Would I go back again? On a good occasion for sure. This place should also be perfect for a more quiet and romantic dinner! First off, Green Valley Ranch Resort is a hidden gem in the suburbs of Vegas. I am told its part of the 'Station' family.   Dinner. We had an awesome wine recommendation, so perhaps the vino impacted my rating!  They brought out a seafood platter that could have fed an army: oysters, lobster tail, shrimp...unbelievable.   Most of the table ordered steaks, and raved. I was just not in the mood, so I ordered french onion soup and buttermilk fried chicken breast. I never order fried chicken...but the server was correct that it was a hidden jewel on the menu. Moist, and Southern comfort food at its best.   Expect a large bill, but its Vegas, which means no more inexpensive meals.   One more point--there is a 15 foot wide glass double-sided fireplace in the middle of Hanks. Too cool. This is the response I get after my review. 1 it's doesn't take 2 hours to get someone suits they have ordered. I clearly stated they came that day cause guys were in from out of town.  Your excuses are bullshit. For the unsatisfactory service. I have no need to call you. I was in there already and expressed my opinion of the company and how horrible service was and all I was told was sorry. My fiance talked to someone there and came in and was told the same thing. You need  a better system of doing things. A 2hour wait for someone to even bring out suits already paid for yo try on is unsatisfactory. My brother in law was there hours prior and waited so long he had to leave also. And you gave him the wrong suits. No other place to rent a suits from needs so many adj. And to actually have to check for stains. What are the people who wash the suits doing. There where stains on everyone's. .. my husband was in a wedding 2 weeks prior with a rental suit ordered on line. Fit perfect. No adj. Needed and your stuff looks so worn over and stitched so many times.. save your breath from any other comments.. Was dragged here on a Saturday night after a birthday dinner. I knew things were bad even as we approached the entrance. I could hear the music blaring from down the walkway, and when we walked in I felt like I was going deaf. The DJ they had was cranking his levels to obnoxious extremes, and with the sterile decor the sound was bouncing in all the wrong directions. It didn't help that the DJ was terrible to begin with.  The bartenders ranged from jock-like dudes and cleavage-heavy women. All of them seemed slow at their jobs and were too consumed pouring dozens of shots and making fancy drinks to get any of us a simple beer. We drank pints of Kronenbourg, which tasted really off and quite gross.  The washroom situation was one I wish I could have avoided: a bunch of drunk dudes waiting in line and hitting on any woman who happened to be waiting as well. I let a couple girls go ahead of me in order to avoid the onslaught of lame pick-up lines.  The crowd was a mixed bag. My girlfriend said the only people who go here are people who already live in Liberty Village, which makes sense seeing as I don't see why anyone who lives elsewhere in Toronto would specifically make there way here.  We stayed here for about 30 minutes. Terrible in every category. Very affordable, drivers are polite, bus is clean and on time. Food is basic Italian and comes with all you can drink wine, but it's around 30 bucks per person.  Not worth it... I don't understand the negative reviews for this place, I really like the pho and in terms of customer service I have never had an issue. The best thing about this place is the actual noodles they use. It has a great chewy texture. The broth has good flavour and it is good value. Also the fresh shrimp roll had tons of filling including different herbs. It is on my regular rotation of pho places. You would think that they would keep in mind that getting married is very special, but from the way we were treated, I don't think they care. First off when I called to get an appointment they asked me what my budget was and weren't friendly. We arrived and they were rude and rushed me out after trying only 2 dresses and kept mentioning how they are highly in demand and always booked. To be honest, their dresses aren't great and are not customizable either. Very disappointed with the service. Would not recommend to anyone Britney is one of the few stars that has ever existed that can command an entire arena, that emits spiritual and psychic positive energy through her voice and performance that has the power to change how an audience feels.  I have seen this countless times, at nightclubs: boring after boring song comes on, but when the DJ plays Britney suddenly the room erupts.  Very few performers had the ability to do this, in history.  Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Judy Garland... the names on this list are surprisingly few.  However, Britney Spears is one of them.  She has the power to illuminate a room, and the World, with her work.  I am not quite sure she realizes this, she is probably far too humble, which is an integral part of  her mysterious Greatness... but I digress.  I did not feel the staff at the Axis theater were worthy of her.  They were rude, rushed me into my seat and out of the theater just as soon as they could, and I barely had time to buy a tee- shirt.  I snuck next to the glass display to take a picture next to the "oops" outfit, and they practically yelled at me.  More so than anything they actually did, their demeanor was extremely GRUFF.  I can't think of a better way to put it.  Nothing exactly happened... no one slapped me in the face or kicked me in the arse... but their words were short, rude, aggravated, impatient, and unsympathetic to a fan that had traveled 5 hours that very day (from Los Angeles) to see his idol.  I am a huge fan of Elvis as well, so we stayed at the previous Hilton where he'd performed and had a fine time touring Elvis' old dressing room. We went to 1 Oak, had a Crab Buffet, and had a mini shopping spree at the Forum Shops. But of all the fun things we did AFTER, I could not shake in the back of my mind the negative cloud of what I'd experienced at the place that drew us to Vegas to begin with.  These people need to realize how much being in that theater means to some people... it is almost a spiritual experience.  When Britney levitated from the tree during Toxic, I almost felt my soul levitate, too!   Shame on them, for poisoning such a momentous experience.  As usual, ignorant peons in the world will spoil Greatness.  But there is enough negativity in the world, a point I think Spears herself combats with her positive soul and music.  There need not be any negativity in the arena of a performer who does so much to expunge the world's ugliness, and there need not be unhappiness spread in the very Pantheon where Spears herself is employed to make us happy.  She was born to make us happy, that is her soul's purpose... so let her do so without the grumblings of those who can only think of what they are going to have for dinner after their shift is over.   Sincerely,  Nicholas Kafantaris This is still one of my favorite sights in Las Vegas.  I don't get tired of watching this over and over again for the combination of designs and choreography to assorted pieces of music in a beautiful setting.  Ahhhhh... I borrowed a friends Costco card with the sole purpose of purchasing the Cackalacky Cheerwine bbq sauce, little did I know I would walk out spending over $100. I love Costco just as much as I love Sams. I am seriously considering getting my own membership to have both. While both sold the same type products, the options did vary at both. Where I found a variation of 1 item at one that the other did have. After walking into Costco i'd felt i'd been missing out on awesome deals. Had an awesome first time at AZ Top Golf. Big shoutout to Kat our server and Michelle her manager, who kept us very happy with food and drink while a swarm of different events were going on from Make a Wish In-progress to World Series Game 1. We had a minor glitch w one appetizer, but they did everything to make it right and then some! You can definitely trust the staff to take care of you. Would absolutely come back, and makes me wish Top Golf would come to the SF Bay Area! First time posting a review and first time visiting Ace of Fades. First impression: this place lives up to the reviews/hype.  We happened to be in the area.  (Walk-in) We were welcomed, the place was busy, but my son was in the chair in less than 20 min.  The cut was the best he's had in a very long time.  EXTREMELY happy.  So happy, I will probably continue to bring him here and make the 20-25 minute drive.  Well worth it! Great place to hang out, such a cute interior! The bingsu is okay. I really like the red bean paste :) So I called the company for a price quote to remove a kitchen sink and install a new kitchen sink and to use the existing faucet. The garbage disposal needed to be taken off and then placed back on. There was no major retrofitting of the drain coming out from the wall. A standard kitchen sink installation. My jaw dropped to the floor! $3500. So I wasn't sure I heard him correctly. I thought perhaps he may have misunderstood me or I him . I reviewed what I wanted and he reaffirmed the price. BLA HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Be very afraid! Maybe my new favourite Italian place in toronto. Great ambiance, attentive service and delicious Neapolitan style pizza - I had spicy Sicilian. All my friends had pasta and based on sampling all 3 I could've easily had pasta and still gone home happy. Maybe it is an Arizona thing, walk into this bar...half the people are wearing plaid the other half look like they are clubbing in skin tight dresses and too much makeup on. The first thing I said to my friend is WHERE IN THE WORLD ARE WE?! Great place for people watching, they had a live country band playing which was cool, but besides that it was an interesting mix of people. 87 West is awesome!  The decor and fireplace create a hip and cozy atmosphere.  I have been here twice now and everything has been delicious!  My favorite dishes:  the grilled four cheese - so many yummy cheeses and melted perfectly the chorizo flatbread - super delish, perfect combination of toppings the baked brie - love the combination of brie and sweet compote  the carbonara - really good carbonara sauce, my only wish is that it had pancetta instead of chicken an bacon  The wine list and wait staff also added to the awesomeness.  Our waitress was super friendly, nice and good at her job. I will definitely be back soon! If you are headed to a Golden Knights game and you want to chow down before hand, stop here for a great selection of foods and spirits.  Prompt, friendly service and a delicious reasonable priced meal for 3 of us including multiple apps and some drinks along w entrees.  Our waitress Tiffany was awesome and Erin wants to be friends with her.  Overwhelmingly pleasing experience. Went to the White Brick Kitchen three times in the past 2 months. Twice for dinner and once for Sunday brunch. Absolutely love this place!   We had the buttermilk half chicken ($17), green beans (special side, changes often. Added $3 on top of chicken) and sloppy joe fries ($14). The portions are really big. I packed a doggy bag from dinner both times. The buttermilk chicken is so crispy and fresh. You can choose to make the chicken spicy for an additional $2. We didn't do that because I'm not into spicy food.  The green beans were baked with cheese on it, which was unique and delicious. The joe fries were really good. They did not skim on the ingredients. A lot of meat! The sunny side up egg was a nice touch. This dish has a kick so beware non-spicy eaters!   The second time I went for dinner, I had the chicken again and a side of cider slaw. The chicken is always good and the slaw wasn't bad. I also had a toffee pudding cake with caramel and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Pretty sweet, but rich and tasty. Good to share with 2 people.   Overall, dinner was great. Only complaint was that the food did take about 20 mins to come both times. I think it's because the chicken was made to order so beware of this if you are on a time constraint. Definitely worth the wait though.   The brunch is only available on Sundays. We had the turkey croissant (special item, changes weekly, I believe. About $14, can't remember exact amount), Scottish eggs ($10) hickory bacon ($4) and homemade ginger beer. Everything was so fresh and flavourful! Loved the brunch here!  The food is on the pricier side, about $25 to $30 a person for dinner and $15 to $20 for brunch, but you pay for what you get here. Totally worth it. Service is okay. Only two waiters working when we went so it was a bit slow, but they were all super friendly! Will be coming back here again! One of my fave American food places for sure! Wow...this show brought up every emotion in me from my first crush, to passionate love, to the pain of losing a parent, and then went on to fill my heart with happiness and joy. The music, the stage set up, the performers...all amazing. I love The Beatles but I think any person would like this show. Warning: beware of the bar's Beatles themed drinks. They are large (comes with a souvenir cup) and you will almost pee your pants because you will refuse to miss one second of the show. I pretty much ran in heels as soon as I could escape the exiting crowd. :P Also, go to the souvenir shop earlier in the day to avoid the after show crowd. I got into a parking lot accident with my 2011 Cadillac and I was referred to take my car in for an estimate at AW Collision. I decided to go ahead and have them repair the bumper. After a week of my car being in the shop, I picked up my car and let me tell you... you couldn't even tell my car had been damaged at all. The bumper looked good as new! The staff here are very friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and they do an amazing job. From my experience, I would definitely recommend bringing your car here for repairs. The chicken fingers were a bit different for my taste but the pineapple bubble tea with Lychee was amazing! CHOOSE A DIFFERENT AIRLINE! Initially,  I was a fan of Allegiant.   Early on , my extended family used it to get to Vegas from the Midwest.  But in the past year, Allegiant has failed miserably in delivering on time performance, bags, customer service , and cancellations.  Allegiant is not a large enough airline to be required to provide on time performance data, but on my last two trips to the Vegas airport, the information boards only showed ONE Allegiant flight that was not delayed on departure.   Not weather, not ATC, but all mechanical issues.    If you are willing to risk delays or cancellation,and view an airline trip as a rapid long distance bus ride on aircraft that are not up today's standards for technology, Allegiant is an option.   If you value on time performance, and expect some measure of good customer service, choose a different airline. We just moved into the area and decided to try the local donut shop. The donuts were tasty and a reasonable side. My Boston cream was okay, but the cream was pretty biased to one side, so it loses a couple points. Verdict: a decent place, but it won't replace our valley favorite of Bosa Donuts. .... my first time was a sunny afternoon in May, in the cool shade of the Evergreen Brickworks.  Six dollars?!  This better be good, I thought to myself.....  That was two months ago, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about that mouth slathering, soul-filling pulled pork, guacamole and tortilla sandwich.  I've been a bit of a boring adult these days; meal planning, watching my language, posting mommy-blog-esque quips on facebook, staying off yelp because I had nothing new or exciting to review... So when I found out that FG's was going to be at the Wychwood Barns beer market I dropped that ladle for the chicken soup I was making for my sick husband like a hot potato, ran across the street and then straight back home to enjoy my two sammiches.  The pulled turkey with purple slaw and bacon jam was tender; sweet but also savoury in all the right places.    The beef short-rib and homemade kimchi made me break out in a post-coital sweat and I assured my husband that, yes, it is THAT good, while I tried to speak between bated breath.  That was lunch.  I just enjoyed the second halves of each sandwich for dinner.  I'm afraid I didn't get the proper names of any of those sandwiches, I do remember them being quite clever.  You will have to find out for yourself next time Fidel Gastro's pops up near you.  And please, give my regards to the one with the bacon jam. Tonia is amazing! I always leave feeling beautiful! She does a great job with the cut and color every time! We came here on a very hot July 4th. Services were great. The waiter got us ice water immediately. So we ordered two bowls of pho, one bowl of bun bo hue, and an order of spring rolls. The spring rolls were very loosely wrapped, not like the rolls that typically from other Vietnamese restaurant. The pho was good not great. The bun bo hue was very very bland, it was pho broth with a little spice color, not good!!!! Handles allergies very well and the food is absolutely delicious.  The service is great too. I come here when I'm in the mood for some fast food that is seemingly pretty healthy. I usually order the same thing... The chicken bowl. I get it with brown rice. Usually brown rice can be in general grainier than white rice. However, I never really notice that at chipotle which is a plus. The chicken can be a bit charred or dry sometimes but it's normally not a problem. I also get the fajita veggies. However, the veggies can be a hit or miss for me. I normally like my veggies more the in the sautéed side but sometimes they can be more crunchy and raw for my taste. I love their corn salsa so I tell the person to like that stuff on my bowl. I do notice that this location does tend to give me a little smaller portion than at other locations. I don't normally review chain places anymore but I'll say this -- this Taco Bell isn't that good as far as Taco Bells go. I don't know why but some ingredients -- especially anything with rice -- tastes awful. I don't know if the Taco Bell/KFC's use a different ingredient base but I can't believe how bad things like the Cheesy Bean and Rice burrito taste. Other than that, it's Taco Bell..what's to say? Our friends live in the Strip District of Pittsburg. When we visited them last fall between weddings in DC & NY, we had fun exploring the area. We were only there for a few nights and it was in the middle of the week so we didn't get the full deal, but the strip is still worth checking out, regardless of what day it is. If we go back to Pittsburg, we'll try to go between Fri & Sun to get in on all the action. After reading some of the other reviews it sounds like we missed out.  We still had fun and we recommend checking it out. I tried Alchemy after a friend told me I needed to seek out a young and hip stylist. Even though I'm 55, I try to keep evolving with the times!! So I walked into the salon and everyone was so friendly, it was like going home. Then I lucked out and got a quick appointment with Noelle (due to a cancellation). She gave me an incredible haircut and, believe me, my hair isn't easy. I have fine straight hair with several cow licks and nothing short of a perfect haircut will work, especially since it is very short.  My next appointment was for blonding. I have been trying to get a hairdresser to do this for three years!!! I could never convince anyone that I'd rather be blond with dark roots than brunette with grey roots. My hair is 50% grey and now I can finally work with it rather than fight it! Also, it took years off my appearance! I can't thank Noelle enough. I feel amazing!!  Alchemy is not your typical meat market shop, it's a full service salon that makes you feel like the special person you are!!  Denise L. Since it's called "Number One," I was expecting to be impressed. This was my first experience with pho and if this is indeed number one, pho must be a very overrated food. The beef and pork seemed to be low quality. Most of the restaurant surfaces were covered in grime like one would find above an oven. The floors were sticky all over. The service was friendly but overall the experience was a disappointment. It takes more than an important name to make a restaurant number one. Every time I visit Las Vegas, I always stop by some some nachos supreme, they are so gooooood. The hot sauce is also great! The place is a little small and outdated but the service is always pleasant! The Cali burrito and mozzarella sticks are also great! Give this place a try! the location is the only real reason i eat here.  it's the first food option when walking from the Engineering campus to Green Street.  the food is not bad but not spectacular either.  you can basically get anything you want in terms of pasta, pizza, or salad.  the cheesecake factory offerings always look good and i'm happy they are there, but i've never actually eated any of that so can't comment on the quality.  lots of seating makes it less stressful if you are hoping to discuss something important with your lunch companions. Very tasty food and nice seating arrangements. Only thing is the food can be a bit greasy - but I guess that's a given with nachos/ burgers/fries/etc. I just tried the Chicken Shawarma and it was AWESOME! Very fresh and the flavors were on point. Great customer service as well! I hope they come back to my neck of the woods soon!! Visited this place after seeing people give it 4.5 stars. I would say it is just about average. The owner has paid attention to interiors but if it is supposed to be depict fine dining, bar and lounge then they need to do something more than just hanging the chandelier from the top. It is not a nice view when you look up because I have never been to a fine dining and lounge space that has undone ceiling. Looks very cheap.  Service was good. Food could have been better. Their raspberry ginger mojito was very good. Their pan seared scallops which they claim is one of their signature dishes was overcooked. The presentation although was very good. Their zucchini fries were average with no salt.  Their spicy seafood pasta which again they claim is one of their signature dishes was average. Pasta was overcooked.  They had some mussels and tiny shrimps for the sake of calling it seafood pasta. Restaurants like this should not cut corners in preparing food like this. We didn' t like their cheap cheese grater. I have better ones at home. Their creme brulee was a disaster. Looks like the chef made no efforts to serve it fresh. It had an overdose of vanilla essence. The caramelized sugar coating was cold, thick and extremely sweet. The caramelization part is supposed to be done just before serving.  Little did we know they serve it pre made. Very disappointing.   We have been to some of the best food places all over the country. So when it comes to restaurants we pay attention to many details. The place failed to sparkle for us last night. Used to love this place but lately they've been cheapen out on their promotions and sizes of their wontons and fish balls. This kind of irritates me because Jim Chai Kee is supposed to be a famous place that does have a lot of regulars eating there. By doing this, it does not only show how cheap the owner is but how much they don't appreciate their clients (especially the regulars). We were very pleasantly surprised with the care and service that we received at Express Auto Spot. My daughter needed to buy a new car, Jason was more than helpful, mannerly, and truly cared about the entire transaction. He explained everything, and answered my daughters millions of questions. After all was said and done, it was a very fair price for a car and he made sure we were completely happy before we left there. I would recommend going there if you want a no pressure, fair, car sales experience. It was a pleasure and what's more, the car lot is indoors, that means no AZ heat!  Thank you Jason, this was great!! I love local businesses and this was such a great way to get out and support. We tried almost every sample and even got free water. Some businesses were giving out free samples as well.  They had local bands playing at the event and also had an area just for the food trucks. Loved all the crafty businesses, too- some very unique and beatiful items to look at and buy. My favorite was the organic soap business. Those soaps not only looked and smelled amazing but were also made from organic ingredients.  All in all, everyone was very friendly and professional and I had a great time. What a terrific find!  Stopped In for the atmosphere and to support a local place. What a delight to find a delicious veggie burger, and some of the best sweet potato fries I've ever had!  The husband's club sandwich, which the menu said was "voted the best," did not disappoint.   Terrific service, great atmosphere. A gem. This is a pretty decent sandwich place. I don't know if it's someplace I'd go to often, but they seem to have quality ingredients and a few pretty good sandwich choices.  I had a BBQ beef sandwich with havarti on sourdough. The bread was nice and buttery, and the overall flavor was pretty good. The included cookie was an unexpected plus. We were leaving a wedding banquet and saw this food truck across the street. So happy that we stopped here! The tacos were amazing and on point! There is a hot dog stand right next to it, which we decided to try one since we are never on the side of town (live in Henderson area) the hot dog was delicious as well!! Highly recommended! It was busy when we got there but the service was good and we got our food fast ( from taco truck and hot dog stand). Will go back to both places if we are ever are on this side of town again. :) There's a lot of dessert places in the area, but their aesthetic presentation really blew me away! Everything they bring out is instagram worthy. Also, the pricing is competitive (in the field) I got the perfect parcel crepe, which was a brownie, vanilla gelato wrapped in a crepe with walnuts, strawberries and lots of chocolate drizzle. My only complaint is the crepe was kind of tough.  My friend got the C'wow (the coveted melting chocolate dome!) so props to them for offering it first. Lots of footage to share. Great service, nice looking store! Good prices & service! Have tried the others and will always keep coming back Exhale Nevada!!! I love going to this bar. Always great and fast service! The deep fried cauliflower is amazing! And Christian gives the best bar service! Love this place. Highly recommended!!!! Great service and very reasonable prices. They have amazing lattes and flavored coffees. The cinnamon cronut is a must. So fresh, crispy and soft. Tips accepted only in cash. Very much enjoyed the pedicure I got here last week - the staff was friendly and professional and my nail tech did a great job. My only complaint is that I could not find a list of services and prices beforehand and therefore did not know how much I would be paying. Great food, great atmosphere, really cool view of the pools in the patio area, and great service. The only reason it gets 4 stars is because of the price. I know it's vegas, but 17$ for a chicken quesadilla is a bit much. Every time I eat here I am never disappointed. The food is delicious, the staff are friendly, and overall is always a great experience. Their house specialty, the shaken beef, is an absolute must to try. Definitely give Saigon Kitchen a visit if you're in the neighborhood. Wow! The best optometrist in Vegas. Much better then LensCrafters!  She explained my sight problems and found great new frames Great staff! I will definitely come back! This place looks like your college dorm cafe with nice decorations. Many variety of food to pick from. Like other post, it is limited on desserts. The highlight of this buffet is their noodle bar, king crab & shrimp cocktail and their PRIME RIB. WOOAH. Service was ok. Only have been a couple of times in the past 5 years and the service was good but the food is just okay. My husband and I shared a dinner together since we are on a budget.  Had an onion blossom (small taste of burnt oil), dinner salad (which they lost the ticket for the order and brought it out after we got our dinner). Food getting cold while we ate our salad and the portion size of the meal wasn't that great, a small piece of chicken, little bowl of mashed potatoes and veggies. I've been coming to this location for over 20 years and the service and food have always been fantastic.  We came here the other night because I had a craving for crab legs. I had the 1lb snow crab legs but instead of having the corn and red potatoes that come with the dish, I opted for the roasted mixed vegetables and a garden salad. My husband selected from a four-course special they were offering and chose cheese and broccoli soup, a caesar salad, shrimp and scallop linguine and the caramel cheesecake for dessert.  Everything I've ever had at this restaurant has been delicious and tonight was no exception. The service was quick and friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable albeit quite a bit more dimly lit than it used to be... you can still see your food, just not the person you're dining with (I kid!) and although the restaurant was relatively full, it was surprisingly quiet.  Overall, a wonderful dinner and I will continue to come here. I came to this location to buy some egg flower soup.  The staff was very friendly and quick. I order my soup, paid for it and was out the door in under 2 mins.  I will definitely come back to this location again Was able to get the tacos today (carnitas) love this place!!! I definitely recommend coming here on country bar night! This is one of the last of a Pittsburgh classic. In case you were aware, Isalys is an acronym for "I Shall Always Love You Sweetie".  In any event, they have solid breakfast game in Westview. It's really inexpensive, and the portions are more than generous.  Parking isn't too difficult to find on a weekend, but they're only open until 2pm - since the bulk of their business is breakfast and lunch diners.  A Pittsburgh original, creator of the Klondike. Check out Isalys if you haven't yet.  You never know when you'll wake up and it's gone like the rest of the 100+ Isalys in the Greater Pittsburgh area. So many knick knacks for the home! I can get lost in this place. They have everything to stay organized for any room of the house. Need to get your garage, office, bathroom or kitchen organized? They have the products for you!   I'm obsessed with their closet organizers- a knock off of California closets. They also have some super cute gift boxes, wrapping paper and packaging. First time I went in I was apprehensive, but you need to realize that it's a school.  Those that are performing services are students.  They will make mistakes but they have an instructor right there to help them learn and make sure you are happy with the end result.  The girl that I had was awesome the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I was there for four hours, which I also expected  but was hoping it wouldn't be that long.    Every person there is learning something and ask your stylist what they need to help them graduate, you will be happy you did because sometimes they give discounts out if the client add-on a service.  I added waxing to mine.  I have to say she did an awesome job on everything.  And with my husband and I we were excited to see our bill was what it would cost for a haircut at a regular salon.    They use Paul Mitchell and Wella products.  I liked the Paul Mitchell color in my hair. My boyfriend and I had talked about this place for a couple of months before finally trying it. I have to say that I love the 50s décor and the friendly service.   I will admit that I'm not a huge fan of burgers, but these were actually good! I ordered the classic cheeseburger with cheddar cheese on the roll. I prefer my red meats well-done, but the patty wasn't dry at all, so that was nice. For an average-sized burger, it was filling and delicious.   The waitress that night was flustered due to a staff shortage, but she still regularly checked up on us and made sure that we got everything that we needed and ordered. The host was extremely nice and gave us a general overview of the menu as we had never been there.   My only complaint is that the French fries weren't very crispy. The seasoning was great, but I was hoping that the fries themselves would be crunchier. Great place, love the shave ice the only reason why I gave them a three start is because almost every time i drive there it's closed next time I'll call to make sure it's open Ordered the sharwama dinner plate and falafel in a pita, absolutely delicious and good portions altho a little price for example the sharwama was $12.75 and the falafel was $9 for a combo with fries and a drink....will need to come back to try their burgers This one of my favorite dining experiences ever. I really loved the adventure and mystery of the whole thing. It was a fun challenge to guess food and an even more interesting one to try and use utensils in the dark. I'd highly recommend this to anybody looking for an out of the box dinner. You really can't see anything in there, it's Pitch Black. Although sometimes you can see the infrared goggles of the waiter or waitress if they're looking directly at you. Ok. You need to know that the best Philly Cheese Steak is actually in Pittsburg. This is the best Cheese Steak I have ever had, and I've had a lot. Order the smoked Gouda cheesteak (it's not on the menu) and prepare for a serious FIO. Next time I'm in Pitts I will be back. Great staff and just a cool, out of the way local bar. Look, this is not a fancy-schmancy Las Vegas hotel and casino like the ones you are used to on the strip. This is a very nice small clean casino that serves mostly locals.  I gambled here for the first time on Wednesday then came back and gambled again on my way back to Los Angeles on Friday. I'm giving it four stars because of the atmosphere and the excellent attitude and customer service of its employees and specially the two managers David and David.  Yes 2 Davids  We had breakfast there on Friday and the food was mediocre at best. But again, the entire place is very clean, it's not smoky and disgusting and even the bathrooms were very clean.  So if you're simply looking for an awesome atmosphere to gamble in, specially craps, I believe you will really really enjoy this casino. But if you are looking for the entire experience, gambling, luxury, excellent food, etc.; then this is definitely not the place for you. I had waited a couple of months before making my first reservation at Lardon and I'm glad I did.  At 6:00PM on a Saturday night, we arrived promptly at the newly renovated restaurant and was greeted by their hostess, Doris, who was warm and friendly.  My party of seven took the remaining reserved table available in this cozy, dimly-lit restaurant.  The decor was simple yet relaxingly sophisticated.  The main entrance was lined by large open windows and the kitchen, situated at the opposite end of the restaurant, offered a glimpse into the brainchild of this joint.  At the pass, stood chef/owner Jacky Lo, ready to command his troops with military precision.  Four members at my table were actually back on their 2nd/3rd visit and I was advised that everything on the menu was to be desired.  Our server was knowledgeable and helped us navigate through the plethora of Italian jargon and we all agreed to order to share.  We settled on the following from their new menu:  Cornish Hen x 2 Steak Frites Duck Confit Parmigiano Reggiano Rainbow Trout  Almost immediately after placing our order, we were surprised by some bread paired with a side trio of sun dried tomatoes, olives, and anchovies.  The table was torn as to which of the three complemented the toasted bread but we managed to clear the plates within minutes.  Personally, I enjoyed the anchovies the most as their saltiness just hit the spot.  Not normally an olive lover, I found the olives to be fruity and fragrant.  As the main course came out, the first thing I noticed was the clean presentation.  As for each dish:  Steak Frites - Done sous-vide style, I had never experienced a piece of beef that was done so perfectly a medium rare (as recommended by our server).  This is in agreement with Meagen B.'s review.  The only complaint that I had was that I was required to share this dish with 6 other people but that's of no fault to the restaurant.  Interestingly, the frites were actually my favourite part of this dish as the potatoes were thickly cut, crunchy on the outside, and soft and buttery on the inside!  Mmm, yum.  Cornish Hen - The hen arrived already de-boned with a crispy, golden brown skin and sitting on a bed of beluga lentil and carrots.  A bite into the hen revealed a hint of sweet alcohol which we later discovered was from the shiaoxing wine marinade.  Not necessarily my favourite dish but others seemed to really like it.  Duck Confit - Normally confined to dried pasta from a box, Lardon's fresh pasta was a first for me.  The duck was succulent but what sealed the deal for me was the sweet pieces of pear that accented the dish.  Nice!  Rainbow Trout - This was probably the star of the entrees and really the best bang for your buck.  The trout had an amazing smoky flavour that was infused deep within the fish, underneath the crispy skin.  I highly recommend this dish especially if you enjoy quinoa!  Unfortunately, I was sitting at the other end of the Parm-Reg so I can't comment on it.  Though, it looked on par with all of the other dishes.  Though full, the entire table shared one of each choice from the dessert menu which included:  Creme Brule - Thick custardy texture, maximum vanilla bean flavour, topped with a crackling sugar crust.  The best I've ever had.  Mango-Lemon Grass Sorbet & Berry-Basil Sorbet - The mango sorbet tasted like a perfectly ripe mango while revealing hints of earthy lemon-gress while the berry-basil was just to die for!  Top it all off with a fresh biscotti cookie.  Perfect.  Chocolate Mousse - Creamy chocolate mousse tower lined with a cookie crust matched with (if I remember correctly) a blueberry compote.  Bacon Maple Syrup Ice Cream - The name says it all.  You need to try this bold dessert on your next visit!  All in all, we enjoyed a laid back night at Lardon along with good service and a well executed meal.  I can't wait to go back and see what the chefs have to offer as the season/menu changes. The service was fast, courtesy, and knowledgeable! The space was beautiful! Set in a restored turn of the century home in Cleveland's Eastside on Larchmere Blvd.   The menu was just the right size and had a little bit of something for everyone. Everything on the menu sounded delicious! For my entree I had the Seared Salmon Special, perfectly prepared! Well-seasoned crispy surface and absolutely flavorful moist center! I ate everything off my plate, it looked like I licked it clean. The cocktail list was short with ahhhh-mazingly creative cocktails. I had the Lemon Jenny and it was delicious, a perfect mix of sweet, sour, and refreshing. They also had a very good wine and beer list.  Felice is a dinning experience must for anyone wanting something off the beaten path. It has a blend of urban, earthy, casual, luxe - hard to explain but, it's different in an extremely good way. I will definitely be back.  Tip: There's only street parking here so get here with time to find parking. Went out of my way to get paint at this store because my carpenter told me to buy here and get a specific type of paint. After buying 300 dollars worth of paint and having it sprayed on, I found the paint was the wrong color. They made no attempt to help in the suituation. I basically spent triple the amount of money on this paint only to have them point fingers at the carpenter. I'll go elsewhere next time and so should my carpenter. I feel like discount or bargain stores like Burlington Coat Factory are a hit or miss. Sometimes you luck out with incredible stuff and other times, you miss out.  I've never lucked out here.  I give most stores that I see potential the rule of 5's... You miss a truck of new goodies, you're between seasons, etc. BCF, well, let's just say I've walked in 5 times and never bought anything... Not once.  I think the big reason I've come away with nothing is the store set-up.  it's so crammed and so messy.  Bad store planning for the lay-out and inconsiderate shoppers who make a disgusting mess.  I did give an extra star for the staff. They've always been friendly and helpful, which always means a lot to me.  I'd rather go anywhere else but BCF - Check the sale racks at Belk or head to Ross before you consider here. Fantastic menu! What west side Madison's been waiting for, ie Grain bowls; fresh; veggie-centric. Frankly, I still see far too many menu's not matching Madison's diverse tastes, we've been beyond meat & potatoes for many years.  Just hope they bring back the fish toast ;) First off let me start with I had high hopes for this place. They have great prices if you are looking to buy equipment or shoot at their indoor range. However, where this place falls short is customer service. If you are not in their group of guys better well forget any help at all. I brought my bow in for tuning and to have fun at the range. However, I was dismissed when one of the guys came in and my tune was put on halt until bros problem was fixed I then left without my bow and was told to call later that day. When I called I was told that they were busy and that "I'm in the middle of something." When I asked how my tuning was coming along I then preceded to ask when I can pick up my equipment and to that I was told when I'm finished. This was very rude and unacceptable when you are speaking to a customer who is just asking a simple question. Two days later my "basic" tune was complete and I took to shooting at their range just to me pushed out once one of the bros came in. I do not think I will be coming back and advise the owner to take a look into the close nit community of bros that has to be affecting business if all new customers are treated the same as I was the last few days. I have relatives that talk about in and out as if it's the best burger in town.  They come off the plane and head for nearest location.   We have tried this place on more than one occasion and feel it's just a burger.  The menu is short and sweet, so no big deal there, the price of the combo's are good, the hand cut fries are crispy and fresh.  We like to get the burgers with the onions, and the fries "animal style".  It's always busy, clean and if you're lucky, you can find a seat. We took a salsa class for beginners and had lots of fun. The place is small but the atmosphere was awesome. We took 4 classes but it felt a bit rushed, there was a lot of technique to learn and I felt that after the first lesson we were playing catch up. The price for the lessons was fairly inexpensive so I would go back for another class.   One thing to note is that you constantly switch partners. If you go without one it's great because you don't get stuck with anyone but when you go as a couple, it's a bit irritating when you don't get to dance together as much. Stack'd is such a solid go-to burger place that you can pretty much text someone "Stack'd?" and they're in.  + As a build-your-own-burger place, you can satisfy pretty much anyone you want to bring. Even your vegetarian, gluten-free, spice-loving friend will be able to make something that suits them.  - This place can get really crowded (especially for the Tuesday night deal), and it's seat yourself, so come early or you might have some wait. There's upstairs seating too, and a bar! - Service is kind of hit or miss. It seems like the staff is always rushing around, so don't expect much individual attention unless you flag them down.  + The burgers and toppings have always been on point for me!  + The $3 half-pound burger on Tuesday from 9PM-midnight is AMAZING.  +/- I've split a milkshake from here with a friend once. Trust me, even as someone with a sweet tooth, I found it to be quite a lot of sugar. Make sure you've got room if you're getting a burger too, or split it many ways.   I'm pretty sure there are more combinations of burgers here than I can eat in a lifetime (you can literally make a burger with PB&J), so I will definitely be back to knock a few more off the list. When we go in to eat its like seeing an old family member. Tottie and her staff always makes you feel welcome.  Bun Tom is one of my favorites --Charbroiled pork, shrimp and Tottie rolls with fresh lettuce, fresh mint, peanuts and rice vermicelli. Pho Tai is great. Spring rolls are awesome. Depending on time of year she makes the most incredible avocado ice cream. Trust me, its perfection. "This is like a cool science experiment!"  My little cutie pie beamed!  There is a huge nitrogen tank that took up the corner of the shop.  So, naturally, I was expecting some kind of entertainment or show from the ice cream makers.  Nope...humdrum.  They kept telling the little boys to get their hands off the fog coming out of the ice cream mixing bowl.  I understand the danger, but be more elaborate and forcefull about it.  Tell them that it gets to below freezing point at 521 degrees and it can give them freezer burns which will turn their hands black and fall off.  See if they ever put their hands under that sucker again.    I like the concept very much, but lacks in execution.  The ice cream, however, was nothing great.  It did stay frozen longer than usual. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and I tell you the meals are huge and tasty.  If you have a big appetite this is the place for you.  If you do not have a huge appetite, I recommend splitting the meal if you come with someone else, which will lower the price significantly.  The reason why I did not give egg works a 5 star was because of the price, which unfortunately is consistent with all the other good breakfast establishments. If you don't mind taking a break from usual toast, please please please try out the banana nut muffin.  It is amazing.  Overall I recommend egg works but if you can split it with someone.  Otherwise you're going to have a massive breakfast to start off your day. A Real Guy Place! I know Sportclips, which I patronize also, touts itself as a guy's place, but I feel more like a man after leaving Downtown Vintage Barbershop. I've been here twice now and with each of the barbers. I can honestly say I feel confident no matter who I get. Good all-around solid haircut with attention to detail. You can tell the young owner really cares about the place and wants to bring quality service to its patrons and is in it for the long-haul. Every time I pass by it seems there is always someone in the chair. Before this ownership it wasn't always the case.  The Downtown Vintage Barbershop is a full service shop. A straight razor is used during the final trim so a real clean finish is the result. A single TV and mags adorn the place and some old-school music is playing in the background. Don't forget cash, as this place takes cold hard American Dollars in the form of Greenbacks only. Waffles were really good. Spruces weren't an arm and a leg and the Spot was intimate. There were cards to play with while waiting which was great for passing the time. Definitely will be coming back. Waffle fries are always good. Chicken always fresh and tasty. Can't go wrong with their lemonade either. One of the best fast food options around! I initially came here for Invisalign treatments and a consultation on the price, etc. I had my wisdom teeth intact and they needed to come off before I could start the procedure. They recommended me to Dr. Daccache, who is great by the way. After that was completed and healed properly, I came back in to discuss my Invisalign treatment. Little did I know, I had some pretty bad cavities on my right top and bottom side(one almost turned into a root canal). And that's when I knew I had to switch to Bella Smiles.  I was led to believe from my previous dental practitioners that I had no cavities and was good to go.    The staff at Bella Smiles are amazing at what they do, and I always feel welcomed whenever I walk in through the door.  I definitely trust them with my teeth to tell you the least! This is a big theater, located inside the Suncost, The seats are stadium, so they very spacious and you're able to enjoy the movie as if you were at home.  The cost of tickets these days, you gotta have some luxury, but is a comfortable chair make up for it?   The popcorn and soda will set you back another $10 or so, and would be a good deal if the popcorn was fresh.  Our luck todays batch is stale. The theater is quiet, clean and very little teenagers hanging around. They took me in as soon as I came in, had a good amount of staff, all very friendly. I got a pedicure from Geric who did an amazing job, very nice, very thorough, very neat. Definitely recommend Because of a convenient location, my go to Thai restaurant is Thai Basil.  However, I was able to try Wild Thaiger since I was in the area earlier this week.  Very, very flavorful Thai food.  I thought it was excellent and yummy.  It was hard to compete against my standard option of Thai Basil, but lately the flavors at Thai Basil haven't been as great as it used to be (must be new cooks?).    Anyways, if you are ever in the Phoenix downtown area, definitely hit up this spot.  Great thai lunch for reasonable prices.  I was able to have leftovers for lunch the next day.  And their thai iced tea was potent, but very, very delish. I like Big Smoke Burger's better than the The Burger's Priest, W, Hero and other places near by on King. The patties taste like meat and are more substantial.  The chicken burgers are great too. You can taste the fire on the meat.  Other burger places tend to focus more on smothering the burger with toppings, which can be okay if the toppings are delicious. Here at Big Smoke I find the meat quality is excellent and juicy -- it tastes like a burger should!  It takes about 10 to 15 mins to get your order. Call ahead if you can.  Staff is full of regular faces and they all work hard and have a good attitude about being there.  I've ordered there many many times and they've never messed up an order.  The poutine is good when it's good but a bit inconsistent. Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's a little low on gravy and cheese.  They have a smoky cheddar which makes the cheese stand out. I find with a lot of burgers the cheese isn't very bold.  Milk-shakes are pretty good but not excellent. I like vanilla and theirs is more milky than vanilla. A tale of two diners...  I am constantly in search of the perfect Pad Thai, so when a thai friend recommended this place, had to try.....  My meal: Pad Thai:  awesome!  Table spices were super fresh (hotter than I expected) and the noodles were excellent.  5 stars.  My friend's meal: Pad woon sen:  2.5 out of 5 (by her reporting); she ordered "combination: chicken, beef, and shrimp" and received LITERALLY one (1) shrimp.  ONE.... The flavor of the noodles was great, she said, but there were way too many onions, carrots, and not enough meat. First time at Hap's for lunch today. Arrived at 11:20 on a Wednesday and it was empty-a little auspicious. More came after I ordered, so I was relieved.    Ordered a combo with pulled pork, hot link, cole slaw and choice of chips. It also came with a small side of BBQ sauce.   The pulled pork was good. Nice flavor but didn't get much smoke flavor-don't know what wood they use. The hot link was disappointing. No 'snap' at all and next to zero flavor. Too bad. The slaw was very forgettable. It was absolutely drenched in mayonnaise and I couldn't taste the cabbage at all. I will try potato salad next time. They offer Dirty Potato Chips brand chips, which is a good choice. I got the jalapeño chips.   I will try Hap's again but will avoid the hot link and slaw. When ever a deli is around, I have to take advantage of the situation and have a bite. Came here for lunch during the 4th of July weekend. I had a BLT and the boyfriend had a pastrami (I think) and watched the Spain v. Paraguay World Cup game. Yummy food. I had to save the second half of my sandwich for later (I was full after the first half!) Great place... Kinda deep inside the casino but worth it! My girlfriend and I were very excited to drop by this new restaurant and was not disappointed!   Highlight: The bruschetta rocked my world in ways I did not know it could be rocked.   The Vibe: unique and welcoming. This is a small restaurant with seats for around 30 people inside and maybe 15-20 outside. Combined with plain wooden tables and fun cutlery, makes this an intimate experience. The middle of the room has what appears to be a homemade chandelier made from glass jars. One wall has a large vertical fern garden (with real ferns!). It was well put together without overstating itself. I love it! Jack Johnson was playing in the background, which added to the relaxed theme.    The Service: Wow! These were some of the most attentive and knowledge staff I have experienced. I never wanted for water (which came with a hint of cucumber). The sourcing of menu specials were described (cheese from the Goat Lady). The server that we had was pleasantly talkative and I could see great opportunities for small talk, if that is your thing. Very courteous and friendly!   The Food:   - Bruschetta (deserving of 3 paragraphs): I am not a bruschetta guy; however, this was hands down the most delicious appetizer I have ever had. This appetizer lived up to the name and actually stimulated my appetite. In fact, we both were left craving more throughout the dinner to the point of seriously considering getting one more order for dessert (it's not sweet, just THAT good)!   This aint no red paste/salsa looking glob on a bread. No, it was asparagus, tomato, lion's mane mushroom (and some more veggie yumminess that eludes me at the moment) perfectly seasoned on a crispy, garlicky, buttery slice of bread.  The only possible downside is that the restaurant changes its bruschetta daily (or maybe weekly), so future experiences may differ. However, I fully place my bruschetta trust in the chief to deliver and WILL be ordering the bruschetta in the future.   - Arugula salad: This came with arugula, walnuts, pumpkin, and pumpkin seeds with a pomegranate dressing. The portioning of the salad seemed in-between a side salad and dinner salad. Definitely get a side or appetizer (bruschetta mayhaps...) if you are hungry.   Whereas certainly not bad, we both found the pomegranate dressing to be a bit too intense and sweet--overpowering the other flavors.    - CM Burger: solid veggie patty with toasted wheat bun. The patty was particularly enjoyable because it was not trying to be like a hamburger in texture or taste. This resulted in a crispy on the outside patty of veggie awesome. The toppings were fantastic. Only drawback was that the patty tends to fall apart easily, but this minor inconvenience is well worth the effort. Would get again!  - Side of Veggies: the burger came with a choice of sides. I choose the veggies, which contained squash, zucchini, carrot, onion, and green beans. These were sauteed perfectly, not soggy like defrosted mixed veggies. The green beans could have been cooked a bit longer, but a minor issue. Deliciousness comes at a price though--butter. And lots of it. Veggies can only taste this sinfully good with a large amount of butter. It didn't bug me at all, but it may be a concern to others.   Overall: Coming back again. Soon. Even though not a vegetarian, I really appreciate well-prepared vegetarian food. There is a lot of variety  and unique flavors at Fern and I am not done exploring yet. Half the tables were empty and they still couldn't be bothered to bring me a menu (I got my own) or even come over to take my order after 15 minutes. Ridiculously bad service. I have used Sky Harbor Airport Parking multiple times for business and personal travel.  There staff has always been friendly and professional.  I highly recommend them. This is a great local bar!! Owners have a great sense of humor!! They will help you try any beer and know what you like!!! Great times and great music!! I went to Streetcar Po-Boys fully intent on enjoying an authentic Louisiana po-boy.  The restaurant is in a sketchy area of town, literally right next door a strip club.  They're located in a run down building, which still reeks of the days it spent as a Chinese restaurant.  Everything is in disrepair: there is a large piece of plywood in the middle of the front door, perhaps from a prior break-in?, the carpet is worn down to nothingness, the fluorescent lights are overwhelming, and blinding, which exposes and magnifies every fault of the restaurant.  There is nothing cohesive about the interior of this restaurant, and the senses are left confused and probably offended. The menu is decent, it is after all a sandwich shop.  The po-boys all sound enticing, with everything from crawfish and oysters, to turkey and gravy, and even a vegetarian option.  The sweet tea is authentic, and the servers are incredibly warm and welcoming, and after ordering, for a brief moment, you're left feeling optimistic. But here again, the weird, decrepitness of the restaurant messes everything up.  You find yourself sitting in weird booths that seem to have come out of a 1950s diner, being served drinks in Caesar's Palace cups, staring at open shelving that's yellowed over time, and now contains a hodgepodge of low-quality bulk restaurant items.  Heat lamps are hung clumsily from yellow chains, low-quality, inkjet printed signs are posted everywhere, the kitchen doors seem to be bloated from water damage, and there's a pervasive odour of old Chinese food mixed with mould.  It's sad, and I was waiting to see Gordon Ramsey come screaming out of the kitchen, cursing everything. The food, was mediocre at best.  The fried pickles were super oily, the meat used on the sandwiches was the lowest, lowest, lowest quality.  I ordered the "Ragin Cajun," which was to come with turkey, gravy and fries.  I thought it would come with shaved, fresh turkey slices, smothered in hot gravy, and loaded with fries.  Nope.  Two flimsy turkey slices, made from waaaay over processed "meat," and about 5 french fries literally smashed atop the "meat."  It was served warm-ish, with a stingy amount of fries on the side.  The meat was so gross, I couldn't eat it.  Overall, with even the slightest investment, this could be a great Las Vegas eatery, but it's location, the building, and the low-quality ingredients make it so I'll never go back, and I certainly won't recommend it to anyone - and in the restaurant industry, that's the kiss of death. A nice small breakfast spot located across from Siems eye center and Dr. Tran's office. I'm not familiar with this area, so it was difficult for me to find this place. Came here for late breakfast. The waitress (blond lady) was very nice and cheerful. She suggested me to get roasted pork belly benedict. Korean boiled eggs caught my eye so I decided to try that also. She said Dr. Tran always order Korean boiled eggs when he's here and it's delicious. My food came out in 25 to 30 min but it was nice that they give complementary chips and salsa.   Roasted pork belly benidict... Delicious! Poached eggs were perfectly made. Roasted pork belly was exactly like "Char siu" you would get in some Ramen shop. Very fatty and melt in your mouths. I was expecting to get muffin type bread but the bread was like french baguette toasted very hard. I couldn't cut with the knife so I had to pick it up with my fingers and ate it.   Korean boiled eggs... When I saw "Korean eggs" on the menu, I thought of "Korean sauna eggs" which you would get in Korean spas (they roast eggs in hot sauna for hours) but completely different thing came out. It was exactly like "Nitamago" or "Ajitama" you would get in any nicer Ramen shop. Perfectly done sweet soy sauce flavored Nitamago. I loved it!  It was nice for the chef to come out and talk to every customer that was there. He was a very nice person. He explained me how to make perfect Nitamago (well, Korean boiled eggs) with vinegar and stuff. I don't know if he's a owner chef or head chef but I hope this place gets a lot of business!! Great Customer Service. The young man with brown hair was kind and helpful. Sorry I didn't remember his name. A very smooth transaction. Great cafe! Super fast and friendly staff. I usually get the chicken curry wrap, on of my favs. Chicken breast in light curry sauce with toasted pine nuts and dried cranberries. Very tasty! Pro's- Service was good.  A couple of the salsa's were good.  Prices not too bad. The soup with the noodle sticks was very good.  Con's All of the food  besides the soup was bland.  All of the proteins were dry and overcooked. Chicken, Pork, Carne Asada all overcooked and bland.  Everything on the fajita serving platter had a burnt taste after about 5 minutes.  Evident that many of the items were not made in house.   If your by the airport try El Fresco's Cocina Mexicana. The best Mexican food I have ever tried. Chicken Latino is a clean establishment with a friendly wait staff and prices that can't be beat. My 1/4 Peruvian-style rotisserie chicken with Spanish rice and beans was only $6.50 (not to mention delicious)!!!! The rotisserie chicken is also the house specialty and does not disappoint. My side of fried plantains was great! Imagine walking through the door of a time machine.  I felt like I was transported back 30 years in the past to the arcade in my hometown of Norwalk, CT.   They have a few games I haven't seen in 30 years like Dragon's Lair.  Not really a musuem as much as it is a working arcade where you can play the games and re-live your youth.  Need I say anymore? This place has the best breakfast/brunch by far! Closes at 2:30 so get there early because the place fills up quickly and there is a steady stream of folks waiting to partake in a great meal. Indoor and outdoor seating. Waitstaff can be more attentive, but the place is always super busy! I tried a skillet...ham, sausage, mushrooms, bacon, and tomatoes on a bed of hash rounds then covered with cheese! DELICI'! All the food and beverages came very promptly to the table. Lydiah's Coffee House is a prime example of what makes small business so great, particularly those in the food service industry! The owner (Lydiah) is incredibly kind and friendly, and the food she makes is very delicious. Every different menu item I've had thus far is of the curried variety, which is expertly done. Not too much, not too little, just the right amount of delicious curry flavor. The small lunch special is economical, but also jam packed with a great amount of food.  The Kenyan chai tea is also quite a treat which I will be enjoying the next time I stop in for lunch. Everything was amazing from the decor to the service. Had a cheese plate, drinks, seafood pasta dish, and dessert. If my wallet was a littler fatter, I'd definitely go here more often. What a hidden gem!!  Happened upon it while at a meeting at The Venetian and so happy I did. Latin American cuisine which is amazing!  The ambiance, the music, the service - wow!!  Highly recommend the crispy potato taquitos!!  O M G!!  The fish tacos - y u m. The Cuban sandwich ahhmaaazimgggg!!  Get the guacamole - comes with chips and plantain chips!!  You have GOT to experience this restaurant!!!A+++ Great place to go for a good meal the lemon aide is to die for great away a good time there we buy gift cards up to 200.00 worth cheese cake what can I say great deserts The menu has very little English on it, and apparently it is incorrectly translated in places. Spent $45 for two meals and two cans of soda - and wasn't completely full when I left. Considering all of the options in this area, I won't go again. Tasty, but not worth the cost. 3 1/2 Stars! Khoury's is A-Ok in my book!   We popped in yesterday to meet another couple for a beer.  Our friends are BIG fans of this place and always speak highly of Khoury's. So we thought it would be a perfect opportunity to see our friends and hangout somewhere new.  The staff was friendly and laid back, the beer was cold, and the glasses were clean. We had a very nice visit with our friends. It was a great way to spend our afternoon and we will certainly return. I have an old-fashioned standard about fish tacos, which many taco places in Toronto fail.  A fish taco's focus is the fish fillet and the tortilla, not the garnishments.  Garnishments make a taco tastes better and unique, but they cannot replace the importance of the fish fillet.  Many taco places I have been to in Toronto want to wow customers with garnishments, but they go cheap on the fish.  They either use fish fillets not fresh enough, or choose a type of fish that is not meaty AND make the fillet too small, so the texture of the fillet is completely overshadowed by a big pile of garnishments.  The Combine Eatery passes the standard.  Yes, the tacos are expensive  The fillets are Basa fillets, a non-meaty fish.  Yet the fillet is big enough that the fish flavour comes through the garnishments, which are fresh.  The texture of the fish fillet stand up to the volume of the garnishments.  The fillet is fresh. The diner controls the spiciness level of the taco.  And this, my friends, is how I like a fish taco. I've been coming to Armando's since they opened, I've only drive through and at any drive through you have to expect the person taking the order might have trouble hearing for whatever reason. Tonight I went to the drive through and the menu board light was off. I asked the person to turn on the light so I can see the menu. They didn't understand what I said so I raised my voice so they could hear me he said to come to the window. When I got to the window the I said I asked you to turn on the light so I could see the menu. That somehow insulted the person and I was told to go somewhere else. Ok easy I went to fredricos on happy valley problem solved. It's a shame the Help can't understand plain English. I will never bother them again. Mediocre Mexican food is everywhere and not hard to find. Armondos just lost a customer because the sensitive snowflake can't understand what I was try to say. I recommend filabertos, frericos, or even Taco Bell before Armando's. The Good:  First off, I usually don't go to shows when I'm in Vegas.  Heck, I usually don't go to shows and I usually just gamble when I'm in Vegas.  This trip was different, it's another story, and what can I say, this show is pretty awesome.  This is actually my first time to a Las Vegas show.  It's pretty much all Beatles music with a Cirque du Soleil performance of their crazy high flying stunts.  There is so much going on that you shouldn't get bored and you'll end up leaving thinking how did they do that?  The Bad:  The lines, entering and exiting.  It's pretty much near the casino so there are huge bottlenecks.  Security is a bitch, they were busting people left and right for pics or vids.   Don't do it, they will catch you.  The Ben:  Glad this was my first show.  It was good and I might be convinced to go to another show, just let me get my gamble on first :D My wife and I simply adore this place. Nestled within a lonely road right off of Lincoln Drive, this place is a hidden gem.  We love the valet parking, the intimate outdoor setting, the views of the mountain and the open sky, and just the overall general atmosphere of the grounds of the Hermosa Inn.  And the food is simply delightful! We've only had dinner here, but look forward to having breakfast here one day in the fall / winter.  We have tried the Halibut, the Salmon, the Chops, and have always been impressed not only with the flavor, but also with the presentation. Truly marvelous to behold, and appetizing as well.   When we visit, it's just fun to sit and chat with my wife as we enjoy the serenity of the area, and the delicious food. And the service is par excellence!  We wholeheartedly recommend this place for special occasions, or a date with that special someone.   Of course, to this day, I've had the pleasure of enjoying those special evenings here with my wife, my pal, my best friend! I've been to Renee's twice and both visits were incredible.   My first appointment was with Cathleen and when I made my second appointment I couldn't get in with her and was bummed, but ended up with Kelly who did just as incredible a job! They really work with you based on your needs. The atmosphere is incredibly relaxing from the time you walk in the door. I walked out of there feeling more relaxed than ever!  Looking forward to trying out some of the package deals in the near future! I can feel the stress melting away just thinking about it.  My only gripe is parking - be sure to think that through depending on what time your appointment is, downtown Willoughby can be a pain. This is a fun place to go to and it's kid friendly too! We were greeted by a nice gentleman that walked us to our area and he was very friendly and gave us information on how to use the golf screen. Then a few minutes later we were greeted by Lauren to ask us what kind of drinks or any food we would like to order. She continued to check on us frequently and made the experience that much better. We ordered a pizza flatbread, chips with salsa and guacamole, and French fries with ranch. We all also ordered drinks that were brought out to us very quickly and we never had to look for anyone to order the next. All the appetizers we ordered were delicious and came out quickly as well.   We did one hour of golf and it was a fun experience with some great views. Also living in Arizona it can get very hot, but they do everything they can do to make you forget how hot it actually is by keeping us cool with misters and fans. I will be back and next time I will be bringing my son. Highly recommended!  I was reluctant since I'm only in town for business and usually get them done in NY.  Amazingly personable and professional. I have enjoyed Paramount's catering for groups of 25+ multiple times and they have never disappointed. I also shared a delicious Mixed Combo Platter (Fattoush salad, chicken and beef shawarma, kafta and shish tawouk skewers, falafel, three sauces) between five friends and it was just enough to fill us up well. For $20 each, our lunch was a bit pricey but the food was wonderful. Service is friendly but a bit slow on Sundays.   If you spend over $15, you get a receipt for a free breakfast on Fridays from 8-10am! Had a fantastic pedicure with Cindy. Hot jade stone massage was a nice touch. Was surprised by no salts or oils added to the water for skin softening even with the spa tub liner. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Will be back! Slowest service at any chipotle I've ever been to. The online ordering process is always screwed up - never ready when it's supposed to be, always missing items. Other than that, great... Good korean bakery! Tried their cake, was good.  And bought bunch of cake and bakery goods! Wish they have a store like this in mn. What a nice surprise! Very please with the service and results of my hair cut and blowout.  McKenna was very friendly and professional and did a good job. I was skeptical in the beginning because my hair dresser has done my hair for over  10 years but I decided to give it a try to this Paul M. School.   My husband went with same lady 2 weeks ladies and also is very happy with his hair cut.  I am planing to go back maybe for some high lights.  Thanks. We had our wedding here on 9/28! It was absolutely gorgeous and perfect! Chastity and Christie were rockstars. Everything was keep on time and I never saw any issues. The whole staff was great! We had an issue with getting our room credit with MGM front desk and Chastity fixed it right away. I highly recommend this location to get married at. We had the Santa Fe which was very good in both size and flavor.  Don't use Cotija Cheese on salads when we make them, but worked on this one.   The Cilantro Lime Vinaigrette added a nice little kick, but not overpowering and complimentary to the other ingredients .  Salad was fresh and did not see anything that looked like it had been sitting out in our salad.  They did have a small chalk board menu by the larger main board that appears to be seasonal salad/other items that do not show up on their website's menu list.  They had down a clam chowder which would be nice on these cooler...for Arizona days and a pear and cranberry salad we almost got which looks to be a seasonal salad?  Noticed they did have a kid's menu which is probably a tougher sell for kids today, but the 4 or so choices I saw on their site did have a variety between them to hopefully find something they will like.  Overall for our first visit the service was fast, the food was good, nice salad selections and the price was very reasonable compared to the other less healthy choices around here.  Look forward to trying some of their other items and maybe a wrap to see if I can eat a salad in the car:) Perhaps the best brisket in town. Pricey though. I ordered a sandwich at lunch and it was $9.50! Our waiter needs more training. I wanted a healthier side than french fries and opted for Cole slaw. He neglected to tell me that all barb b q sandwiches have a compote of Cole slaw. So I had 2 little containers of mediocre slaw. It was not busy at noon maybe 10 customers total so I suspect the masses found a $6-7 lunch more palitable. The drink prices were basically downtown rates too. That means high for Mineral Point Road. I have eaten here twice and each time the sushi (chefs choice) platter was excellent.  As with anything on the LAs Vegas strip, it was pricey but delicious.  Be prepared for a walk as Sushi Samba is in the back of the Palazzo but it's worth the walk. Greasy but delicious! The lettuce wrap burger falls apart and gets all over my hands but it's worth it. Our first stop in a wild bachelor party weekend around the Phoenix area. After doing some research for lunch I decided on the arrogant butcher. What a great name for a restaurant located in downtown Phoenix directly across from the Arizona Diamondbacks ball park. With a solid 4 stars and over 1200 reviews it had to be outstanding right? Unfortunately the arrogance overcame the actual experience that we received. Arriving during happy hour the restaurant was extremely dead, but spring break, vacations etc, I'm sure it's normal in Phoenix. The service was just ok, the server seemed to take forever for our drinks, food and even the check. The drinks were watered down and not mixed right, one tasted like vodka and my second was more tonic/cloudy. The food was also just ok, the oysters were terrible, burger average and the best dish by far was the pork nachos. I'm sure this place is outstanding and it was an off day. I'd give it a try again maybe for dinner then next time I'm in the area. Ordered 2 big dinners here and drove to pick them up. Upon arrival the girl who came out of the restrooms with a broom was pretty rude from the getgo by TELLING me to go to the OTHER register. She brought the BIG shopping bag of food out and I gave her a Bob Evans coupon that was on my phone. She took it upon herself to CAREFULLY read every word and informed me that you could NOT use it to purchase a TURKEY entree ! I could NOT even see all the tiny fine print. So I was counting on the bill being $4 off because I had a valid coupon $4 off $20 . I had another Bob Evans paper coupon with me and asked to use that coupon. She CAREFULLY studied it and said I could use THAT coupon for a turkey entree EXCEPT that is for DINE IN ONLY.  So I let her know that I would have to leave the 2 meals there and I was sorry I could NOT buy them without the $4 coupon being used. She said...O.K. and I will tell you 100% for sure, My family and I always had breakfast here for a LONG time but because of the $4 coupon, I will NEVER,EVER return here due to the TERRIBLE "CUSTOMER SERVICE" and COMMON SENSE that is lacking from this girl. Choose to accept a $4 coupon by manually entering $4 with the help of the manager OR refuse a LEGITIMATE $4 coupon because it "can not be used for a turkey entree" and piss off a customer that will NEVER come back and they LOOSE a BIG SHOPPING BAG OF FOOD now and throw it in the trash. Great Call cashier girl ! Lol A bit out of the way  to get to if you are visiting on the strip, but if you are a hard-core Raw Foodie, it is worth the drive. the menu is quite limited, but what is there is very well prepared and flavored. I think it's one of the best raw food friendly eateries in the valley. Generally they will offer you a free sample of anything before you buy! That shows they stand behind their food, as they should.  They also have a little shop with a few things to buy. Always amazing service. Fantastic menu items. Ask for Travis hes the man!! Went for the first time this Saturday.  This is the first place in a very long time that actually took the time to review my hair regimen and provide recommendations.  Jodi also recommended hair products and how to manage my hair in between appts.  I think I have finally found a permanent hairdresser :) One update to my review, after spending an evening there...  The music needs some serious re-consideration. I was stopped mid-sentence when the music went to Heavy metal, followed by cheesy 90's songs, including, "Tootsie Roll" OMG- disgusting selection and no flow.  Get a DJ a la BarChef or pick a theme and stick to it.  (If the theme you pick includes Metal or Cheesy 90's I'm not coming back, though.) Live music starts around 10pm and is decent, singer is cute and has a nice voice.  The crowd eventually filed in and by 11pm, the main floor and upstairs were packed. If you want to reserve a spot, call well ahead and they'll set up a table or a few couches for you upstairs.  I was pleased with the prices, though. For 10 people, lots of drinks and chocolate pieces, only $200 or so! Great dinner! We took my lil niece for her 8th birthday dinner & she loves this place! Our waiter Steven M. & he was awesome! Always there to fill our drinks, salad, soup & breadsticks! My niece enjoyed her dinner & the singing when all the waiters came with her dessert of choice & sang to her! Very good quality food & service! Thank you & big shout out to our wonderful waiter Steven M. Met some friends here for breakfast. The server was friendly enough but it took FOREVER  to receive anything we ordered. Attempting to pay our bill took a really long time as well. Nice atmosphere, can't say I was duly impressed with this place. In a pinch I would go back. Nothing to write home about. Food was standard. Good food. Decent portions.  Somewhat slow for not being that busy.  I love the huge soda cups so we don't have to get a refill every five minutes.  Had great special happy hour prices. I have been here twice now and love thw food! However, the place has a Soup Nazi like atmosphere. The owner runs a tight ship and you need to follow the rules. For example - The food is all made to order and they wont take your food order until it is your turn in the queue. Also, there is a note on the menu qbout a $5 charge for being a rude customer. At first I thought that was a joke, but am pretty sure it isnt now.  I find all of it part of the experience of eating there. They are closing June 1 so try it while you can! Why I'd go back: to grab a coffee and study or sit outside and enjoy a beer with a friend  Great place to go if you want to sit and read a book during the day and enjoy some coffee or grab an Arizona brewed Four Peaks beer with a friend.  Nestled back off of Cave Creek Road, the atmosphere is low key and inviting.    The only thing I tried here food-wise was a turkey panini that was good.  Not amazing but for the price and my hungry stomach it filled the need.  One of the last things worth noting are the friendly and genuine staff.  You do not feel rushed and their interested in talking it up a bit if not helping another customer. Wonderful Indian vegetarian food from South India. In incredible doses, mango Lassi and other healthy  Indian fare. Nice attentive  owners  and great service. Loved this place. Look I've seen this place compared to Venezia's and I have to disagree, Jimmy and Joes wins!  The amount of food you get for the price is spectacular.  They have their own hot sauce which is greatly superior to other Hot Sauce's.  The staff is friendly, and the food comes out quickly.  The pizza itself is delicious, great sauce and dough, and the toppings are wonderful.  Im glad they finally made a location closer to Tempe!  We used to drive quite a ways to the Chandler location. I know you work at a car wash, but put a little pride in your work. Car never gets clean here. Exceptional customer service since I walked in the store! They also had amazing deals I could not refuse to & got extra discounts for purchasing more than 1 wallet. If you're into this brand, I'd definitely  recommend coming here to save extra money if that's what you like! Holy Crap! This place just blew our minds this morning...hubby and I came in a little after 9am because other places we drove by were just stupid packed and we wanted to sit somewhere comfortable and low key with good food. I've been eyeing this place for a while now and what a perfect time to try them out. We sat by the window, we had a new waitress but she did great with timely service and great interaction. They serve chips with a yummy banana nutella spread while you wait for your meals.  We ordered tosilog for the hubby, green eggs and spam for me and shortstacks to share. The meals were delicious and hit the spot for us...we were so into our dishes that we didn't even get a chance to dig into the shortstacks - we ended up taking them home for a later splurge. I was a little bummed that they upped the prices by a couple dollars from what is listed on their website (someone needs to UPDATE that stat), but in the end it was still worth it. Eggs were cooked perfectly for both meals, the green thai butter used on mine gives it a nice kick of flavor and spice. Spam pieces were fried just right, not underdone (yes, this is possible) and not overdone. The tocino was marinated pork belly - again, great flavor and texture.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the little details incorporated into each dish...garnishing was spectacular! The chef even came by our table to check on how everything turned out - that was a very nice touch...From other reviews, it looks like kitchen efficiency can be a hit or miss I guess depending on when you get there - glad we got there when we did, because when we left, the crowd certainly picked up and it appears that the kitchen got backed up from what another review states of their experience from today as well - I remember seeing that couple come in with their baby, it's too bad they didn't get a spectacular experience.  Hubby was greatly impressed with this place and that says a lot as it's very hard to please him. We are fans! My second visit to Olive & Ivy is what convinced me. Not that my first experience wasn't spectacular. It was, but I really steeped in it my fiance this weekend for brunch, and it isn't that our meals were just perfect, it's that the service was very friendly and attentive, as well.   My fiance ordered the Eggs Benedict with breakfast potatoes, and I had the Bacon Cheeseburger with a side salad. He cleaned his plate, and ate whatever he could of the half burger I couldn't finish. His only comment was that he preferred the hollandaise a different way, but that's because we make it ourselves at home.   The Bacon Cheeseburger was amazing, I order it medium. If I could have finished the entire thing I would, and the red wine vinaigrette on the side of greens is the best I've had in a while. I'd love to be able to make that one at home!  We ended the meal with the strawberry shortcake dessert that was interesting...not what either of us was expecting, then again, not sure what we were expecting. It was good. I'm sure there are better choices.   Our waiter really made sure we were comfortable, enjoying our brunch and our experience. We walked out of there smiling, stopping by the marketplace to order the large Cactus Blossom iced tea on the way out. Owners are some really nice people. Clean, busy, right off the freeway. Easy people to deal with. I had a pretty negative experience here.  I was told that my design was "about the worst design possible," which was condescendingly explained as being because I wanted it to have a circle in it, but "the human body isn't flat."  Really!!! The human body isn't flat!  No way!  I'm pretty sure I've seen a lot of people with circles in their tattoos before.  I have a tattoo on me already that was at least as complicated as the design I brought in to cyclops that they essentially refused to do.  I appreciate that the artist I talked to was honest about what he thought would happen if he tried it, but given that there are about 100 other places on carson to get tattoos I was surprised that he was so rude.  I definitely would have been thankful for expert advice about how to improve the design, but we didn't get anywhere by him simply deriding it.  I also appreciate that a tattoo salon is not a department store where every employee is always expected to be cheerful and respectful, but my previous tattoo was done by someone much less apparently put upon when asked to try a challenging design.    In the end I'm glad that I didn't get tattooed here, because I wouldn't want someone that treated me that way stabbing me with needles.  I give them two stars instead of one though because the place was very neat and clean, and the example art on the walls looked pretty good (but to my inexperienced eye equally as complicated, if not more so, as what I wanted but was refused).  I guess if you really don't care how you are talked to and you want art that is their specialty, it would still be an ok place to go. I wish I could  give them no stars!!!  This is the worse place ever!!!!! 1st- super Dirty 2nd- everything broken including arcade games 3rd employees not professional at all!!!!   Really Dirty and Old!!! Great Experience! Great Results! I had a great experience with my sessions. Greg was very friendly and explained every step of the process. I felt very comfortable during my visits and got great results! I will defiantly return for more sessions for colon hydrotherapy as well as try the corrective massage soon! Laseraway is amazing! As a woman with permanently tanned skin, I was ecstatic to find a laser place that knows what they are doing! I have had amazing results!!!   The only reason this is not a 5 star review is that at times the technicians rush through the treatments without marking the area and spots are missed. Other than that, they are great! Obsessed!!!! That's pretty much all I can say! I absolutely love these classes the studio and Kassel. I never though I would get back to the shape I'm in these classes kick your butt but are so fun that you don't even notice your working out until the next day when you can't move lol. I look forward to going to classes each week I've never felt that way about "working out" so if you need to find something that motivates you to get up and is also a complete blast you need to check out Desert Air yoga! Jenny Brown handled my haircut like a BOSS! So you get free shampooing with a haircut, and since she used to be a massage therapist it was relaxing. She clarified what I wanted and was friendly. Jenny did an awesome blowout to top it all off! I even asked for my bangs to be a little shorter and she didn't disappoint! If you need a haircut, color, or a good blowout, I strongly recommend asking for Jenny Brown My husband needed some new work shoes, must be skid resistant and affordable.  He's hard on shoes, so we got the "bogo" last time we bought here, but today, they weren't offering that program.  The price for today's shoes, $45.  Not really a bargain, if they last at least six months, we're doing good.  I had someone tell me about Sketchers, so next time, we might try them! So I'm only giving this hotel an extra star because of the customer service I received from Alicia. I'm one that takes reviews into consideration but I also like to come up with my own. Arriving at the hotel it seemed nice. Slightly run down but nothing to bad. Upon entering the room was a different story. Immediately when we went into our room it smelled like sh*t literally. The ac unit on the wall only made it worse blowing out warm air. The carpet was dingy, the sunken tub was filthy and there were burn marks everywhere from the room to the restroom counter. Even though they advertise non smoking can't blame them for stupid people making breaking the rules. Within the first 5 minutes I honestly had to vomit from the smell and did. We immediately went back to the front desk and let Alicia know that we just couldn't stay. She was very apologetic and helpful and let me know that if I notified groupon for a refund she would honor it. So thank you Alicia for your customer service. If rumor can get the cleanliness in tact with the customer service that Alicia gave their profit and customer feedback can improve. All my family dogs have gone to Caring Hands, so when I finally got a puppy of my own, I knew exactly where to go. The staff at Caring Hands really know what they're doing. Penny, my puppy, needed to get her nails trimmed. Since getting bigger, she's gotten more difficult to trim so I brought her to Caring Hands. After three appointments, they finally got her nails trimmed (by no fault of their own - I'm telling you, Penny is a monster sometimes). Penny has never seemed stressed or unhappy after leaving and everyone there is extremely kind - they even remembered my childhood dog, Bear! Five stars. :) The dollhouse was an excellent experience for myself and my two friends!  We wanted to have a girly night out, and of course, part of that involves getting our hair done.  I found out about the Dollhouse through a friend of mine, who highly suggested we try it out.  I am so glad we did!  They wash and condition your hair, massage your scalp, and put a fragrance of your choice into your hair.  I chose spearmint, which smelled heavenly!  Then, they give you a glass of water and champagne with a sweet treat in it.  I normally don't like champagne, but this glass was amazing.  Then they ask what kind of style you are looking to get, then work their magic.  My fine flat hair looked supermodel gorgeous when they were done!!!  My friends and I had such a fun time here, and I suggest this place to anyone looking for a girly thing to do with their friends. Toppings - Yum!  During peak meal times, this place gets crowded - fast.  A great assortment of free 'fancy' toppings on burgers means you can customize to your delight without spending $16 on a suped-up burger!  I always order mine with everything, which means I usually have issues maintaining my graceful, ladylike appearance. It's always worth it.  The sweet potato fries are good, but the onion rings are great. Order those with a side of chipotle honey mayo, and you will feel complete. Dane and his crew are amazing. They showed up on time with a crew of 6 and three trucks. The made a masterpiece out of a huge neglected mess. We have a few very large pines, olives, palms and even a pomegranate tree. The best part was them not only quoting me 900 less than another company. They came in under budget. I would recommend them to anyone. While I wasn't spending much time in my room, the time I did spend was very nice.  Very spacious and open.  I love the patio with the pool and the view of Vegas.  And as folks have mentioned, it's nice and close to the Strip.  Only drawbacks are the whole "you have to enter the room and insert your hotel key to start the AC" thing.  Those rooms are effing hot when you first come in and it takes forever to get them cool.  Also, the fitness center is pretty underwhelming. Great Show.  My 7 year old also loved it and got most of the shows.  There are some adult innuendos that made it fun for the adults as well. The magic was old fashioned but still amazing.  We got free tickets (with a purchase of a drink) after we went to the Grand Canyon through Viator. Ordinarily I wouldn't go here, but since it was walking distance from my hotel and I had no desire to drive on the snowy roads, chain food became acceptable fare.   I want to know why this place has Cajun blackened mahi-mahi on the menu when they don't cook it with an ounce of Cajun seasoning?  I got a plain grilled fish.  The cauliflower and cheese side was nearly indistinguishable from the mashed potatoes.  Only small chunks of cauliflower which probably had all the nutrients cooked out of them signaled which dish I was eating. Wonderful SE/E Asian style sandwich/breakfast shop with its Malay owner's DNA baked in. She's mostly nailed the street food/hawker center interpretations of the western sandwich (WTF sandwiches as we used to refer to them in Korea). The only disappointment was the kaya toast. It didn't seem to have the familiar pandan flavor you'll find in Singaporean kaya joints like Ya Kun. So, yeah, alas, if you're looking for Singaporean style kaya toast, you won't find it here. But you will find other good stuff.  It's not a big place, seems to be constantly hopping, but these are not meals people linger over. Eat and get out. Wait probably won't be long. I was actually impressed. Given the room rates, this place was a pretty nice location.  The lobby was elegant and stylish. The WiFi signal in the lobby was solid. The rooms were pretty good. And the service was pretty nice as well.  We needed some suits dry cleaned overnight, and they worked with us to get that done and taken care of before we checked out the next day. They could've easily said it just wasn't possible, given it was was a weekend and their usual press facility was closed, but they found a way.  Located close enough to some decent food locations, and also a pretty good view of the lake.  No free internet, which seems archaic. But I guess that's just how it is. You'll have to pay per day.  But all things considered, I'd probably stay here again. Done, gone, repossessed!  How you have a semi-crowded to crowded bar yet cannot pay your bills I have to figure out. Wife and I decided to try Bubba's after driving past it for several years.  Nothing much to look at inside, but that's ok.  Decent beer selection and good menu choices.  I had the N'walins burger and wife had boneless chicken wings with chipotle dry rub. Burger was very good.  Nice and juicy and cooked nicely.  Chicken was a tad overcooked, but still good.  We also had the fried pickles.  They were pretty greasy but after draining they were really tasty.  Lots of them, also.  My fries were not greasy. I went in yesterday looking for some luggage... What used to be pretty recognizable brands such as Samosonite, wasn't really anywhere to be found.  While this location boasts an expansive "home / housewares" section, make-up & fragrance, it's just really a lot of merchandise packed in any space they can put it.   Upon looking at the luggage, which was totally a mess, I didn't see anything that caught my eye.  Not to mention, it was a "ghost town." I didn't see any other customers or associates...& this was around 12 PM. Needless to say, I walked out of the department (& the store) empty-handed.  The good thing about  Belk is they ALWAYS have sales & ALWAYS have clearance areas.  Back in the day, you wouldn't catch me shopping for clothes, shoes or accessories anywhere but at Belk. Clearly, my tastes & budget has changed, so unfortunately, I don't shop at a Belk hardly ever these days. A young couple owns this place.  They're nice enough but this 50ish woman found them a bit condescending.  The gal cut my hair, but didn't do what I'd asked for to make my style less heavy on top/front.  She called her husband over for assistance. He ended up doing what I asked, but the questions he posed as he was cutting were a bit insulting.  I'm sure he didn't mean it that way, but I didn't appreciate being asked if I fixed my hair on a daily basis.  I asked for a short easy style that could be jazzed up on occasion. I left feeling a bit insulted.  Won't go back, but wish them luck! Wanting to try something new, I stumbled across this place through a Living Deal, completely new to yoga. Started with a beginner class taught by Martha and was hooked day one. The instructors and atmosphere are great--welcoming, caring, and not at all pretentious or intimidating.  It truly is "simply yoga" and that's what is great about it.  I would highly recommend Simply Yoga for anyone wishing to practice yoga, beginner or experienced. I love love their princess chicken dish. The curry here is perfect and their takeout is always super fast. It's my go to spot when I have a Thai curry craving. Highly recommend! Lots of great, out of the box menu options and traditional crepes for the less adventurous. I went to Paul Mitchell The School after I saw a $19 Groupon for $30 towards a service.  I called at 9:30am to make an ombre hair color appointment with a Phase 2 student.  The receptionist was able to book me a 1:30pm appointment that same day with Jaymee.  Even though Jaymee is a student, she really knew what she was doing.  She was teaching a newer student (Rachel) about the techniques for ombre.  It made me feel very relieved when Jaymee was explaining each step of what she was doing.  Because I have very long, dark, and thick hair, I knew the appointment was going to take a while.  After starting at 1:30pm, I was out by 5pm.  This is understandable due to my hair and because students need to review their actions with their instructors.  Keep this in mind if you are thinking of coming here.  I feel 100% satisfied with my hair color service by Jaymee.  I also enjoyed the complimentary hand and arm massage I received from Rachel.  Overall I give the service I received 5 stars!  My ombre dye job cost $50, after I saved $11 from buying the Groupon.  What a great deal!  My suggestion would be to request a Phase 2 student (especially Jaymee!) if you are planning to get a color service.  It is well worth the extra ~$10.  Another great thing I found out is that men haircuts are $5 on Tuesdays.  You won't regret it if you come to the Paul Mitchell School.  If you're hesitant, please remember that all students will be supervised by a licensed professional. I ordered a Thai salad, fruit tart, and a cinnamon roll. The Thai salad was mediocre. The chicken tasted off and the dressing tasted like thousand island. Same with the cinnamon roll, it was mediocre. On the site they claim they're made fresh, but it tasted stale. The best part was the fruit tart, no complaints about that one. Caveat right up front. I was attending a JT concert and hadn't been to a concert in a large venue since Prince in LA at the forum. So if you've been to the forum - anything is better. Having said that - I'm not sure what they do with their employees because everyone and I mean everyone was soooooo nice. You had to wait in long lines to get cocktails - but everyone was so nice you ended up not minding....that much. The acoustics we're great for JT but the opening act - not so much. The only thing I didn't like is because it is such a large venue even great seats weren't that good and up close. Our experience at Camelwest Animal Hospital has always been excellent in every aspect of our pets care.  Dr.  McCready is outstanding and the staff is very friendly and prompt to make our appointments as enjoyable as possible.  If you need an excellent veterinarian who is experienced, caring, knowledgeable,  and who will minimize when possible the cost of quality care for your pets, Camelwest Animal Hospital is the facility to go to. This review is way overdue... sorry Destiny! My husband and I got married at Mandalay Bay and had our reception here. Right from the beginning Destiny was AMAZING. Everything was so easy and she was so helpful with our decorations, letting us know about any promotions, dealing with the cake delivery, and answering any and all questions. I could not have had a better experience. Her entire staff was so helpful and nice. They made everything stress-free. Not to mention the food was AMAZING! My in-laws, who are almost all chefs, couldn't stop complementing the food. Overall, it was an amazing experience!! Thank you guys so much! Great food and super affordable drinks. Highly recommend this restaurant if you are on your way to Cleveland. Service was great also. They all work together which you do not see often. Now that the seafood boil trend has been going for a while, I feel like I can come here without having to work through the crowds.  Our group came in and we ordered the Captain's Boil, and the two other seasonings with mussels, clams,  and shrimp.  I ordered a fish and chips for myself as well as a side of corn.  First of all, the place is very conscientious of hand washing, with a washing station at the front entrance.  When you go downstairs, the washrooms have a sink inside as well as in the hallway!  Bonus points for that.  Also bonus points for their caesars which use a fresh stick of celery in it.  Food was a bit garlicky for my taste though.  The seafood came nice and hot, but the flavour of the garlic overwhelmed the seafood for me.  When I took the last piece of clam out of the bag, I couldn't taste the freshness of the clam anymore even though I could tell the seafood was fresh.  I was glad I got the fish and chips, which was perfectly fried and had generous portions.  It didn't help that the minced garlic tasted like it came from the industrial sized tubs you can buy in bulk pre minced.  I did use the sauce to dip my cajun fries with though, which is the best application of the sauces.  In short, I think I enjoyed everything about this place except the boiled seafood. Waited in line for over an hour. There were eight people working the counter but only three or four of them were actually helping people. No idea why this is so slow. No excuse for making people wait in line over an hour to rent a car. Will never use Budget again. Manny, Luis, Freddy and Beto arrived on time and were very professional. They completed the replacement of my new AC system ahead of schedule and left the area clean. Manny was able is answer any questions I had and communicated well. I would highly recommended them. Always good.  One of the best places to eat in the Phoenix area.  I always get the Purista, which has a generous helping of imported parma ham (prosciutto).  Get it with sliced sourdough so the amount of bread doesn't overwhelm the experience.  They have an excellent wine selection and much to choose from for imported Italian foods.  It gets busy, so plan ahead and bring someone with you to grab a table while you order. I come to this place every time I visit Arizona and always walk out with multiple purchases. This store has bows and hair accessories for all occasions and all ages of you think outside the box a little. I consistently get complimented on the things I buy there and put in my hair! Definitely a great stop if you're in the mood to jazz up your wardrobe hair-wise! We have trusted Bonnie and Mike with our clothing and household items for 20+ years. We've always had excellent service, never a bad experience and they are very friendly folks engaged with Fountain Hills.  Prior to their opening, we had so many hit or miss experiences with the other cleaners, we went to Scottsdale instead.  Mike and Bonnie created a jewel for Fountain Hills. This is probably the worst experience I have ever had with in n' out in my entire 29 years on this planet. This chain closes at 1:30 AM on Saturday nights. I specifically pulled up at 1:29 AM when they proceeded to turn the lights off in the drive-through and failed to even acknowledge my presence. They served the car in front of me yet failed to even speak to me. This is not my first rodeo upon closing hour, and the right thing to do would have been to take one last order before that 1:30 mark. We pulled up and they made sure to cut the lights 30 seconds AFTER we pulled up into the drive-through. This is the closest chain to my house but sadly I will not be returning unless somebody makes it right. Sincerely, a very unhappy camper. I am INCREDIBLY disappointed after reading all these great reviews. Perhaps the doctor is great, but his staff is AWFUL. I called to say I was running late. Left a message because no one answered. Nowhere does it say anything about if you're 15minutes late that your appointment will have to be rescheduled. I get there just over 15 minutes late and the woman at the front desk was nothing but rude and unpleasant. She claims she called me back but it didn't go through. Apparently she hit the call back button and it didn't go through. That was the only attempt she made. She didn't bother to actually dial the number I left. I am getting visibly upset as I try to figure out a solution as I have been sick for two weeks and can't afford urgent care, and certainly can't afford to get any sicker, and she LAUGHS at me. She tells me she can't get me in until next Tuesday. I ask to speak to someone else as she's made it clear it isn't up to her. She calls in a gentleman who is the only one who says halfway nice. He steps out and sends in another woman who is also AWFUL. She continues to repeat herself saying she doesn't know what to tell me and she can't help me. She gets snappy with me and rudely says "then go to urgent care!" At which point I explain I can't afford urgent care and isn't it their whole purpose to help people out who don't have insurance. She shrugs her shoulders and again with a horrible tone says "I don't know what to tell you." And the whole time, mind you, the phone lady is continuing to argue and defend her lack of effort to reach me. I am a grown woman who has never broken down crying after dealing with unpleasant people. But they managed to change that. God forbid I get any more ill... Ordered delivery for me and the kids. Two hours later, our meal arrived. I called to inquire after about an hour. Was told that the delivery was on the way. Minutes later received a call that it was being fired and would be delivered soon. Do you think it was on the house? Nope. Just got a piece of cheesecake and  20% coupon. Not good enough.  Now, let's talk food. The meatball "panini" was a piece of French bread with a bland/acidic sauce. The meatballs were overcooked and dry. Not a pleasant experience. The pizza sauce was also watery and bland. You'd think that a place called "Sauce" would have figured it out by now. Not so. Serena is amazing! She knew exactly what I was needing done and did it perfectly. The maids are awesome they really listened to what I wanted and did it as well! The process was smooth and was done in a timely manner! They do the best cleaning job I have ever seen! I will be back and if you're reading this I highly highly recommend you give them a call today!! Absolutely cute little pinball joint! So many pinballs but be aware that the money does add up because it is super fun and pretty awesome!  There's plenty of parking out front.  Bring cash so you can exchange it for quarters.  I highly recommend! Went there for first time in long time.  Had dim sum.  So good. And reasonably priced.  Thoroughly enjoyed. But they charged us for green tea.  Usually comes with Chinese food. Otherwise enjoyed. I was visiting my friend from out of town with another vegan friend, and she took us here for Sunday brunch. It is hands down my favorite place and I wish they had one in NY/CT! We got there early to make sure we could get a seat since the line apparently gets long. The brunch included an entree PLUS the brunch. That was definitely more food than needed, I would have been happy with just the brunch, but wanted to try the entree as well. So I tried to take tiny portions of the brunch food just to get a taste.  The setting was super cute too! Very quirky and fun. The prices were a great deal too. I had to drive around a block for parking but found parking on the street. I hope to go back next time I'm in Pittsburgh! Really loved it.  Had to wait a bit for a table,  but that's not a problem.  Food great, and really friendly, smiling wait-staff.  Definitely recommend for breakfast! The food is MEDIOCRE. I usually don't do Yelp reviews, but I feel like I was robbed... I had the Pupusa plate - Salvadorian/Mexican plate. First of all, as I smelled the plate I thought this smells like microwave and old...hmm maybe not too many people order this plate. Second, I thought the menu said potatoes and bread- nope didn't happen. Third, overpriced. Fourth, the food 100% didn't taste fresh - smell, taste, texture, you named it it WASN'T fresh. Fifth, I ended up in the bathroom. Sadly to say, try another place for exquisite food. I hate to do bad reviews on small businesses....However, something has to change read and pay attention to the YELP reviews. I didn't bother complaining because of the other reviews, sounds like the staff/owner do not take too well on reading/hearing criticism or simply from a PAYING customer. Good luck. Went for dim sum. The food is pretty good, and well prepared.  They have all the standard dim sum fare but they also toss in a few unique items. This time we had a green tea paste that they shaped like leaves. Tasted like very concentrated green tea.   Its always busy there bit the kitchen manages to get dishes out rather quickly,  and very well done, not just slapped together.  The only hold ups we have ever had was with the wait staff getting the food to the tables quickly. They sometimes don't have enough staff so service is slow.   But the food us great. Thumbs up, would recommend this place! Really good spot for lunch. Had it two days in a row for lunch while in Vegas for a business trip. Time and time again, tracking shows as DELIVERED, package nowhere to be found.  Paid extra for Saturday delivery - can't be located until Monday at the earliest, if ever.  Avoid like a plague! Made my online reservation with Hertz as part of my airline discount package in order to rent a car for the weekend of Electric Daisy Carnival 2011. Everything within an hour Vegas was BOOKED solid, and I mean solid. I was able to find one of the lodges 2 hours out of town that had space, so I was set.   ***Here is the important part of the entire review: I got a discount because it was PREPAID.  I got off of work, made it to the airport on time, checked in early, everything a-ok, even had my print out of my reservation and info to pick up my car rental at 10pm on Friday. I go to the ticket counter, and the staff is taking their time. Fine, I can still make it to the lodge on time and check in. This is also important, because the front desk is not open 24 hours. After midnight your screwed. The receptionist was willing to wait up til 1am for me to check in, though. But no later, as this place is so small no one else is at the desk until 5am. With only a few people in line in front of me, I should be ok.  Nope. Staff is so incompetent and computer system is so archaic that 30 minutes passes before the NEXT person is served. The manager tries to get people to use the Hertz electronic kiosk, as she can tell we are all frustrated with how SLOW the service is. I'm a savvy travel and think this should not be a problem and take the kiosk route with a few others. But the couple in front of me have issues with their reservation, and flag down the manager to help them (she is VERY pregnant and can't deal with the stress of 10 minutes of nothing working).  My turn at the kiosk. I try several different methods to get my reservation. Scan my print out. Type in my reservation number. Put in my credit card info again. 15 minutes of attempts, and nothing. By now I would've been in the front of the line. Finally the kiosk recognizes me, and tells me to SEE AN ATTENDANT about my issue. I get back in line and wait another 10 minutes before anyone can help me (thank God they didn't put me in the BACK of the line again).   At this point I WASTE another 10 minutes as the reservations agent at the terminal can't get my reservation to go through, despite the print out and online info on my phone. THEY ARE SURE WILLING TO TAKE YOUR MONEY, BUT NOT GIVE YOU THE CAR. They cannot take the credit card I provided. YET THEY WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE MONEY.  When I showed them that I had been charged already (yes, I brought out my bank transactions, this has happened before and this usually works) they STILL WOULD NOT RENT ME THE CAR I HAD ALREADY PAID FOR.   Now the manager gets involved, as she can sense my frustration with the staff to a perfectly simple and logical transaction. And what can she do about it? Nothing. Not willing to get on the phone and talk to Hertz, or to over ride. Is this for REAL? A rental service that operates 24 hours a day and you can't get anyone on the phone to fix this issue? And she wasn't going to try? EVEN THOUGH THE RESERVATION FOR THE RENTAL WAS PREPAID AND YOU TOOK MY MONEY?!  By now in my anger I had missed the call that the receptionist at the lodge was checking in with me. Whatever TIME I had buffered to make it to the extended deadline to check in at the lodge was now SLIPPING AWAY. Knowing that my frustration was mounting, I walked away and waited in line at another car rental agency and got a car.   That's right. Walked up, waited in line 5 minutes, talked to an agent from a competitor and got them to MATCH MY CAR TYPE AND DISCOUNT with HERTZ and get the paperwork car within 10 minutes TOTAL. I went back to the HERTZ desk and asked to make sure I was getting a REFUND FOR A CAR RENTAL THAT WAS PREPAID THAT I WAS  *NOT* GETTING.   Guess what the manager said?  No.  At this point I cussed out the agent that initially helped me and the manager because they know NOTHING about customer service. You can't release the cat to the same credit card you were MORE THAN WILLING TO TAKE PREPAID MONEY FROM, and WON'T REFUND THE MONEY when you can't give me the car. No print out that says I was NOT given my car when I call Hertz billing come Monday.   By now it's 11:30pm Friday night when I drive off in a non-HERTZ car, and I have to fly like a bat out of hell to make the deadline at the lodge. I would have to deal with Hertz later, as I had wasted enough time with them.  I've rambled enough, but in short guess who SLEPT IN THE CAR in the parking lot of the lodge? Surely it wasn't a HERTZ car that I slept in, no sir-ree -bob!   In summary, even with all the paperwork, print outs, online info and correct identification info on my person, HERTZ would not rent me my prepaid car, nor would they refund it. Due to the length of incompetent  time and poor service I received at Hertz, I did not make my reservation on time at my lodging.   AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.  p.s. Guess who is on hold with Hertz billing as I write this? In the daytime the owners work so don't go there because they're mean with the portions it totally sucks ... if I go in there and see the wife or the husband I'll be turning around... fuck that bitch Spent the last morning of our trip to Phoenix having brunch at Lon's.    First off it is a beautiful outdoor garden setting.     We ordered the "monkey bread" to start.   So yummy, sweet and delicious, really did want to lick the bowl but this place is just a little too classy for that.  The kitchen did a wonderful job in tailoring the entree's to our food allergies so big thumbs up for that.  The breakfast pizza was wonderful but on the smaller side and the goat cheese was applied unevenly resulting in 2 slices with a large amount and 3 with almost none.    Taking a few extra seconds to even it out would have been a big help.  The breakfast hash was good not great but I'm not really a fan of short ribs so maybe that's a we ordered wrong not really the fault of the kitchen.     We did look at the meals served around us and all were really well presented and looked fantastic.     If your looking for a great place to "check out" of the city and relax for a wonderful brunch experience.  Lon's is your place I agree with others that this place is average or subpar in terms of service and food. It satisfies that craving but there is definitely better ramen out there. I've been here about 5 times. The broth here is rather flavourless generally and the noodles do have that "soapy" or strong alkaline flavour I find. But nothing is offensively bad.   I mean, if the service was excellent it would make things better, but it's not! I would kill for this brisket and then request it for my final meal on death row. In fact, I would kill myself if I found out the good Lord above served this in heaven. The cheesy, jalepeno grits are also incredible. So the owner of this restaurant called me back and apologized. He was completely horrified. The way this owner handled the situation was great. I will definitely give them a second chance. Do yourself a favor and go here! There were 50 beers on tap and even more in bottles. We tried several types and our server, Daniel, was very in tune to what we liked and made several great suggestions to get us to try new ones.   ASK FOR DANIEL! He is outstanding and knows his product! If you want to try different kinds of beer and eat some great German and Traditional American or Canadian food, then this the place! I always hated urgent cares. But because my boyfriend has been having health problems and can't afford to always go to the ER we came here. There was no true doctor to help, as well as the medicine they prescribed him was all completely wrong. He had visual problems in the office and they saw but still gave him wrong prescription. How is that even possible? Lovely location and atmosphere. Not so great food. We ordered the beef dip and crepe. Beef dip was stone cold, and we got a replacement it was still cold. Crepe was so crispy that it tasted more like a quesadilla. French food awkwardness. Well...After reading the other reviews we decided to give DC a shot for Valentine's Weekend.  Not a good idea.  Once again they were not prepared for the crowd.  We had a 7pm reservation, called in 4 days in advance, and we were seated at 8pm with no menus, no bread, no wine, except us whining that we felt like this was an episode of "Hells Kitchen".    We had to laugh (group of 6) and we were not in a hurry, yet we had to ask for everything, server, wine, another wine, ect...  We finally got bread at 8:22pm, and after the bread the salad, and steaks came out pretty quick, but they could not figure out who's steak was who's...and the three women's steaks were all delivered to the wrong person, one had to be sent back, ordered M.R. brought M.W., not good...brought a new steak Rare...and the same person got shorted wine from the person as they tried to pour to all six  of us from a bottle of wine brought to the table uncorked with the cork in the bottle, not good...  All of that on our first visit ever to DC, and they did not offer us anything for compensation, no offer, no nothing..."sorry we are still learning"..."thanks for your patience"..."It's been overwhelming" told to us by our server...  It's really too bad, nice place, nice people, my steak was perfect and I love the fact that they serve every steak with sauteed mushrooms...love em, and the price point of the menu is right on...Wine list could be better especially for a "Steakhouse" they are competing with some heavy hitters in the Southeast Valley, they better step it up a bit...  Crazy thing is everyone wanted to go back to give them another try when they aren't busy, go figure...not sure I will. Came in today around 4:50 pm and theres was 2 guys here, the taller one served me and he was SOOOOO nice! both guys are nice.. the tall guy just had great customer service. please let those guys get acknowledged for their customer service. the shorter one greeted me as soon as i came in and the taller one was super nice and talkative. they both washed their hands and the place is very clean. perfect place to eat. Love their food!! Service is insanely quick and the margaritas are delicious! Perfect place for some authentic Mexican cuisine! Will absolutely be back! Have been to Olive & Ivy in small and large group settings for brunch, happy hour, and dinner with consistently good experiences. We had my Stepmom's surprise 60th birthday party here--the event space was easy to book--our event space was indoor/outdoor with great views of the Waterfront canal. Well I'm no Irish pub expert by any means but I really liked this place. Granted my wife took me here for my bday on a Monday nite so can't say what it wld b like on the weekends but the food was great. We loved the patio. Staff was very accommodating for getting us a heater for my wife. Will check it out on a weekend and rate again. The food was ok (had bruschetta and the limoncello cake) however, their hours state that they are open until 9 but they close the kitchen at 8 and started putting chairs up at 7:30. One couple walked in thinking they could order dinner and had to leave. Pretty poor business practice for a restaurant. If you want to close earlier, change your hours. One of my must stops in T.O. is Congee Wong! My MIL recommended Keung's instead this time to try and because she's such an awesome foodie - we went to check it out.  We got congee (of course) in Lai Wan (very tasty) and Special (has liver chunks). The congee was really tasty and my hubby had an OMG moment over the flavorfulness of the special congee. We also got Chinese donut (very crispy), Singapore radish cake (not as good as Congee Wong, but decent), and crispy noodles (ok). My GIL says that usually the meals come with a free drink and after a simple asking of the waitresses we got free hot drinks (milk tea, ying yang milk tea, coffee, and lemon tea)! The prices are very reasonable (much cheaper than in the States for sure).   Restaurant itself was clean and I can't wait for the next time I'm in town for more! Fast service on the night I went, part of 4. horrible food - deep fried calamari was so dipped in so much batter it was rock hard; tom yum soup was way too sweet instead of sour and spice; stir-fry was oily. Save you $ and time, go elsewhere. We went there for dinner the other night, being in Vegas for the weekend.  We had driven by a couple of times, and had it pointed out during the "Haunted Vegas" tour a couple years ago.  Putting it simply; the food was incredible!  Being from NY, I am an Italian food snob, and this was some of the best I have ever had.  I had the veal scallopini, my wife had the chicken marsala and we were in heaven!  Then, we had the canolis for dessert!!!  The service was fantastic as well.  The place was pretty busy, but service was quick and friendly and the atmosphere was a lot of fun.  This is definitely a place we will visit again next time we are in Vegas. Ambiance:  Let's start with the location.  This Mexican-Korean fusion bar & restaurant is located in Korean town.  It is one of Playacabana restaurants or the MAS PLAYAS Group.  However it seems to be influenced by the neighbourhood.  That is why you can see many Mexican-Korean items on the menu like Baja fish taco with kimchi, K-Mex Slaw, etc.  Barrio Coreano can be a good choice for people who wanna explore a new taste of MEXICAN-KOREAN food.   The restaurant is quite small but I think they can accommodate up to 40 - 50 guests.  If you like RUSTIC DECOR, FUN & FRIENDLY ambiance and don't mind to be very close to other tables, you will like BARRIO COREANO.  Food:  We ordered quite a lot because we didn't plan well , also misheard when our waitress told us that they ran out of the special beef steak taco.  We though it was the White Fish Taco that was out.  So we ended up ordering two items of fish tacos, the White Fish and Grilled Baja Fish .      - Fish Taco : The white fish taco was good but I'd prefer the baja fish which came with kimchi. Three baja fish tacos are for $13. If you have only one is $5.  We got three. They were very tasty.  - K-MEX SLAW ($12):  We wanted to try something new so we ordered K-Mex Slaw as an appetizer. It came with a huge dish of Korean Cabbage, creamy fresh Mexican Cheese "Queso Fresco", fresh Avocado, Corn, and topped with Ginger-Sesame Dressing.  It was an interesting dish.  However, I am a chip-eater  so I ordered the Guacamole & Chips in the end   I couldn't finish it though.  - GUACAMOLE & CHIPS ($9): I heard that their Guacamole & Chips were good however, it might not be my day.  My chips were a bit burnt and not warm as many people claimed .  The Guacamole was good though.   - GRILLED KALBI BEEF RIBS ($14): My husband ordered the ribs instead of the special steak taco that was run out.  He said these Korean Short Ribs were very good.  The Arbol-Tomatillo Salsa and Cucumber-Radish Kimchi made the dish more delicious. The Arbol-Tomatillo Salsa brought a kick of  spiciness. As I mentioned, if you like a taste of Korean food, you would like these Korean Short Ribs.   - *Dipping/ Hot sauces: Don't forget to ask for their house hot sauces! It is the MUST if you love spicy! I asked for it a bit late when I was about to fish my tacos .  I didn't plan well..I didn't plan well!  It came with four small bowls of different hot sauces.  The red one is the spiciest!!!   Drinks:  It's a bit harsh if you don't have Mexican food with alcohol, isn't it!?  Makes your journey a bit more fun with Michelada! A Mexican drink made with cold beer "Modelo Especial ($7)" and mixed with clamato juice, freshly squeezed lime juice, hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce.  I normally don't like Bloody Caesar or a drink with hot sauce.  However, this MICHELADA ($7+$2) totally changed my mind.  I became a spicy-drink lover .    Barrio Coreano also have other interesting cocktails.  They are $12-$14.  We didn't get any cocktails this time.  We had only Michelada and Beau's Nordic Pale Ale (600ml for $12).  The Nordic Pale Ale is brewed in Ontario.  It was dry and low to medium bitter.    Dessert:  - CHURROS POUTINE:  a sweet version of Poutine.  Sweet Churros dipped in a rock glass filled with warm caramel and melted marshmallows . The dessert that you will fall in love with  if you like SWEET.    Service:  - Reservation: It is a good idea if you make a reservation.  We didn't do it though.  Luckily they had a small spot for us at the time because the customers was about to leave when we got in .  Make sure you ask your server for everything you may want at once so you won't miss anything and don't have to wait.  They seem to be busy in the evening, especially on weekends.   Price:  In my opinion, it's a bit on high price side for some items.  However, taco prices are average.  I would recommend to order one each of tacos to try out with their house hot sauces.  A bottle of beer would be nice with spicy food~   OVERALL is good I'll have to say as a first time visit here this place was great the food was good and the service from the staff was great the options of games to play on a driving range were awesome definitely not a boring night will definitely go again Great Food, very busy around 11-1. I would suggest waiting later if your trying it out. Pizza was delicious hot and fresh as well as the Parmesan fries and jalapeño poppers we ordered however, the customer service was extremely lacking. We had to constantly track down our waitress for water and basically anything else we needed because we were not checked on once the entire time we were there. I am not sure if it is because we went later in the evening but, I do have to mention the waitress seemed overwhelmed. We took advantage of the $29.99 pp for 3 meals deal (mid-week only, it's $39.99 on weekends)...we were also staying in the hotel and had a $35 meal credit, so two of us ate for the entire day for $25.   Definitely not a bad deal at all.    The buffet is ok, but really  nothing to write home about.     We got there right as breakfast was ending, so I won't blame them for running out of several things.    Breakfast selection looked pretty standard (breakfast meats, pastries, omlet station, etc).   There were also a few entrees and some desserts out, but I'm not sure if those were already being put out for lunch, or if they had them out during breakfast as well.   The blueberry pancake was amazing (not standard individual pancakes, more of a bluberry pancake batter baked into a dish and scooped out with a spoon).    Lunch was decent...there was nothing in particular that stood out, although the desserts were pretty good (loved the chocolate tart).    Similarly, dinner was reasonably good but there was nothing that was particularly amazing or stood out.  The roast beef at the carving station was probably my favorite.   Many of the same entrees and desserts were repated at lunch and dinner, which is probably to be expected but was a bit of a bummer, since we were hoping for a little more variety. Because of Dr Dykman and the Bullmoose staff, my girls will be able to turn the world with their smile! The first time I ordered, it was great. I ordered a second time, they forgot one of the toppings and gave us garlic balls instead of the breadsticks... no biggie...  So we ordered a third time (all within a 1-week time frame, Fri- Fri)... I informed the woman about the previous mistakes, she said we should have called them that day. Okay, fair enough...  The delivery took over an hour. Not to mention,  the delivery guy in the black Lexus wasn't friendly and had an attitude like WE were the ones who were late.  The pizza was wrong and the breadsticks were burnt. I called the restaurant,  explained what was wrong with the order. Mind you,  the children had been waiting over an hour to eat, so they had already taken a couple of slices from the pizza... the woman said the chef said the bread was fine. Really?  Because I offered to text them photos of the black bread we received!! She then said she would replace the pizza ONLY IF NONE OF THE SLICES WERE TOUCHED & IT WOULD TAKE ANOTHER HOUR (putting us past 7 pm, when we ordered before 5 pm) After explaining our situation, she spoke with the manager and came back to say she could offer a $2 credit off our next order.   I said that was unacceptable. I spent over $120 with their business in the past week. She said the manager would call me back... I NEVER RECEIVED A CALL.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, THEY NO LONGER RECEIVE OUR BUSINESS, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN $500/MO EASILY. Best sushi, nice staff, awesome prices!  Favorite sushi place in Cleveland!!!  Been going here for years now and have never had a bad experience. Always delicious and fresh! We bring our two dogs to Diana to be groomed quarterly and I am always pleasantly surprised that she remembers who they are when I make the appointment. The grooming is always affordable and very well done.  On top of that, they are always ready about an hour before what she originally tells us when I drop them off which is great because I usually miss them quite a bit when they are there! Whoa! This was an unexpected last meal while in town. Yelp helped me sort restaurants,  and when I saw BBQ towards the top of the list..decision was easy.   The meats here are truly outstanding. Brisket was amazing...great crusty bark and beautiful smoke ring on the tender beef. The pork ribs have to be in my top 2 best of all time, up there with LA BBQ. The sausage went down nice and smooth. Not too spicy, good snap from the casing, and slightly coarse ground beef and pork blend. That's the texas trinity,  and I never expected to have it be so good in Arizona. Bravo!  Sides: I tried the beans, potato salad, and grits.  Beans were slightly too thick for me. Very hearty if you like it that way. Potato salad was a tiny bit undercooked.  Just personal preference for me..i like it easier to bite through. Grits were awesome though, really tasty!  Make sure to get here early. We arrived at 10:30AM on a Saturday and didn't sit down to eat till 12:30. My favorite mall in Phoenix. Away from downtown, in a nice area, nice stores. Great food court. Not crowded at all. Will definitely be back when I am in Phoenix again. Decent environment and tolerable food but poor poor service and a problems with the taps? It took forever to get a beer and it appeared as if it was because the staff was having trouble with pouring them. When I got it finally it tastes flat. I would have sent it back but I didn't feel like waiting another 10 minutes. Could be a decent place if they cleaned up their act a little but there are better options for now. Not impressed.  The place had a stale odor when we walked in.  We thought we would still give it a chance.  I wanted a Moscow mule.  No such luck.  We left after the first drink. My first time at new location. Food as usual is out of this world. 5+/5 Decor and atmospher is similar as before. 3.5/5 Service is similar as before. 4/5 Location even easier to get to now. 5/5   - Lots of free parking on side streets.     - TTC pretty much right to the door. Currently no alcohol but sign in front showed an application for it. All in all, if their service was bad i would still come back just because their food is that good. Not worth the prices they charge. Food was ok, service was mediocre, decor was average. This restaurant wont last long with the way it currently is. Shame! I would never use this company.  We called for a Taxi on new years at around 9 o'clock, they said many were in the area and we should expect one soon. We then called back at 10.30 after no cab had arrived, and they said they would let the driver's know we'd been waiting an hour and a half and that there were taxis in the area. Finally we called back at 11:00 having already missed our show, and we were told that there was no way we could get a cab that night. Why didn't you just tell us from the start we were never going to get a cab?   Absolute worst service, from the grumpiest people I've ever experienced. I sincerely hope you go out of business. Airport choices are not the same as they are at a local Smash so don't expect to find a kids meal or a combo meal with ease.  All items are a-la-cart so keep that in mind if you're ordering a burger fries and drink.  I went with to Smashburger one order of fries and two burgers ran me about 18 bucks to feed too young adults. I did make a special request as far as the items on the burger and also to have them cut in half. Probably the most frustrating part was that I ordered two burgers and I watch just one burger was sitting on the top heater along with the fries for over five minutes and I was waiting on the second burger.  The orders went in together and should have come out at the same time.   I don't like food getting cold fold especially when it's freshly made which I appreciate but it took way too long for the other burger to come up.  When I did it was more of a rush order to eat but still satisfying. Wonderful service Dr. Andersen and her staff were knowledgable and very friendly. The facility is very clean and well organized they have an open door policy and have puppy visits which help socialize your new pup. Great boarding options and I love how they have puppy cameras available to ease your mind. Husband was craving Chicken Teriyaki & gyoza, so we found Musashi. I was very unimpressed. We started with gyoza and edamame. Neither were anything special. We then ordered a chicken teriyaki plate and a few sushi rolls. The chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce. Was not good at all. The sushi was mediocre at best. While they were friendly and the service was pretty good - I will not be back. I stopped by this morning to pick up a latte and a muffin on my way to work - it was around 10am, so long after the morning rush (if there is such a thing in Harrisburg). I waited and waited and waited for about 5 minutes for the barista to stop flirting with a customer who was in front of me - they were basically just chatting - then I threw up my arms and left. I want to support local business as much as the next guy, but at least I know if I walk into a Starbucks, I can get in and out in 5 minutes.  Skip this place, if you have anywhere to be. Got time to waste? This is just the place. Weston favorites pizza, is an old home style type of pizzeria. The service that you will find there is far better than you will ever receive at any other pizzeria in town. The pizza itself is so perfectly done, the toppings that they use are the freshest that they can find. I'll be honest with you when they first opened there was a few hiccups that they had but they corrected those rather quickly. The owner had to have been exceedingly brave to open up a pizzeria practically right across the street from a well-known chain pizza store. But Weston favourites pizza are able to deliver a far superior product at the same price as a major chain pizza store. If you're ever looking for the best pizza outside of Italy head over to Weston's favorite pizza it surely will not disappoint. Some dishes are hit-or-miss, but the XLB (soup dumplings) are the best I've ever had, hand to god. Can't go wrong with the cold sesame noodles.  Beef roll was also scrumptious.  Dan Dan noodles didn't contain one grain of pork, though not advertised as such, I generally get some pork love in my Dan Dan.  Noods arrived quite mushy, hence why I preferred the cold sesame. Potstickers arrive in a way that I had not seen before - cooked as a sheet and with a crisp bottom - fascinating idea, but it prevented us from cleanly separating the dumplings from the rest, so filling got torn out. Veggie dumplings were stuffed with mealy, pureed - turnip, maybe?  Felt like it would definitely be adored by the kiddos, but it ached for some seasoning. We tried the East end location of Pizza Libretto for a ladies' dinner.  Wanted to get reservations for a Wed. night but told that none were available so we decided to chance it.  Arrived around 6pm and was seated in the downstairs level, right at the table next to the bar.  Ordered some wine and appetizers to start - warm olives ($5), gnocchi ($5) and buttermilk calamari ($11).  Their calamari is usually a favourite of mine but this version was a bit over deep fried.  Texture was kinda tough.  The coating wasn't as fluffy as I once remembered.  Gnocchi was coated in a creme fresh and lemon but a bit bland tasting, not a lot to it.  For pizzas, we got the classic Margherita ($13), Cremini Mushroom ($17), Ontario Prosciutto & Arugula ($16) and the special of the day which was a pizza with lamb and rapini ($18).    It's been awhile since I've had the mushroom one but it was great and I even loved it over my Margherita.  Desserts - how could we say no?  We went with the Tiramisu, Posset al Limone and Chocolate-Amaretto Budino, all $7 each.  The Posset was awesome...a light and refreshing lemon custard.  Tiramisu is always a winner.  Sweet and boozy, just how I like 'em.  The Budino was okay.  More like a chocolate mousse/pudding.  Service was great even though the restaurant was packed both up and downstairs.    Libretto is a great standby for an evening of pizza and gossip. Just had my car detailed (got a Groupon) and they did a really nice job. I have to be honest, I was expecting poor quality due to the other reviews on here. However, two people showed up early to my home and took about an hr and a half for my CRV. The car is very clean and looks great! The people were very nice and even helped me as they were leaving to put the antenna on my car (I'm pregnant and they didn't want me to have to climb up, even though it was off when they got here). Bonus - once they come out once they told me they will always honor the groupon price for future detailing! This seems like a smaller company than many, so expect to wait a few weeks to get on the schedule, but I was very impressed with the quality of work and the price and will definitely be using them again! Drinks-4.5 stars Waiter (Frank)-5 stars Food-4 stars  The canoe appetizer was so yummy! But for 10 bite sized pieces of food, $26 is a bit much.   My husband had the prix fixe and it's an awesome deal. The bi bim bap appetizer was tasty but a lil on the small side. His hangar steak was done to perfection. The soufflé dessert was great if you like super chocolatey stuff.   I had the fish trio. The seared ahi was ok, but the salmon and butterfish were the better of the 3. If only the butterfish tasted more like miso like it was supposed to.   Overall, great and solid 4.5. I'm from and love the one in Hawaii so that's the only one that gets a 5 from me :P Came with a large group for a special occasion.  We decided to see what's the hype in this prestigious duck.  Throughout the dinner, we experienced up-selling of the duck, why this duck is worth the price. Each employee had said different things - so here is a consolidation of the differences between $88 and $118 according to the restaurant:  The $88 duck is a 4 lb duck, vs $118 is an 8 lb duck.  Only the bigger duck have enough surface area to carve out the peony flower.  This flower presentation is also copyrighted in China as of 2014 - therefore you can only experience the unique presentation at their restaurants.  The duck is LOCAL. Regardless what they say, these ducks are not flown in from Beijing.  A waiter did tell us only the $118 is from a specialty farm, vs $88 is not (we asked the Manager to get the right story)  The pastry/pancake is from Beijing - to maintain its "quality".   The finely green spring onions are specially ordered from a vendor - as it is unique in its "fine chopping skill"  When you receive the duck at your table for the presentation of the carving, you will be given a show, including a "gong" to start the show, and to see how the peony is created.    Was this duck good? It was tasty. However as the skin was so finely carved out, I found it was difficult to appreciate the crispiness of the skin.   3 stars for the service - we did get a lot staff which came to explain to us on the restaurant history, the food detail, and explanation of the menu. We had a staff specially stayed around to serve us (why? I don't know why, he just floated next to us). HOWEVER, everyone was very courteous, and we appreciate their consistently walkthrough of each dishes and story-telling.  Were the other food good? They were all very flavourful - however generally more greasy, with higher price then typical Chinese restaurant.  We anticipated to have the Squirrel Fish, which unfortunately the waiter forgot to put into our order (our table did not make a big deal, as he was very courteous. It did look good in the other table).  Would we go back? For the price, we may consider going elsewhere.  Limited parking in the front compliment to customers. If not available, hotel parking is available at the back at $0.50/ half hour. Definitely the best and tastiest Kabob Dinners in GTA, i guess  But, not a good place to sit and eat your food... lots of kids around, crying :-(  Also, I don't like their queue/no system, (you are supposed to get your order no., after paying the money) I forgot get mine, and the beautiful lady messed up my order. So, I had to wait for long to get it corrected ;-) I agree with everyone else who has complained about the staff (and the gross, stained coffee mugs). Our server was very rude. He made snarky little comments about everything I did. I'd never had this happen to me anywhere else. I don't know how anyone can speak with such attitude and be so critical towards a customer that they don't even know. It was very strange and off-putting, I don't think I'll be returning.  My portion of food was decent, I wasn't able to finish it all (got a rude remark from the server about that), but my friends portion seemed very small. It tasted alright, nothing too special. It certainly didn't make up for the bad server. There are plenty of other placed to eat where the staff won't make you feel like crap. This was overall pretty bad.  I went in with high hopes of fresh ingredients and lots of...you know, herbs and flavors.  Our server was kind and attentive and I had a salad that a monkey could prepare well, so I'm giving two stars for those successes. But, my salad had no flavor besides a few olives to set it apart from a standard side salad you'd get for free at a Red Lobster or similar cheap chain.  The beets were just beets in a bowl, absolutely no flavor at all.  The margarita pizza my friend had was shocking considering this being advertised as a Mediterranean/Italian fusion spot, and she didn't have the heart to send it back.  It was clearly a cheap (or poorly, previously made) frozen pizza that they tried to disguise by throwing a couple of slices of tomato and a few sprinkles of unfrozen (note that I'm not using the word "fresh") cheese on.  She was starving and swallowed parts of two pieces, then I took the rest home thinking my husband or father would eat it since they'll eat almost anything, especially in pizza form.  Even they wouldn't eat it, so that was $8 or so in the trash.  I hate writing bad reviews without talking to the staff to give them an opportunity to fix it, but it was pretty clear that there was no pride or care given to the foods served there.  It was not the waiter's fault and no "chef" that allowed that kind of food to be sent out to a table would make a fresh pizza and flavorful second batch of beets had we sent them back. Love sushi and great service? ? Well this place is perfect for that.  Unpretentious,  delicious super relaxed atmosphere.  Went here for lunch after someone recommended it.  The to go boxes are yummy,  my fav was the purple looking roll with crunchy stuff on top of it.  We got complimentary soup, adamame and ice cream. The service was superb! I thought the food was amazing! My friend said the beer on tap was amazing too. Only thing was that service was pretty slow, and I found it a little pricey. Make the burgers come with fries too!! I was disappointed when it wasn't :( Outstanding from start to finish.  I ordered the chicken which was perfect, and my husband ordered the Cornish Hen, which he said was delicious.  We can't wait to return.  Now shhhhh don't tell anyone....we want to make sure we can get in whenever we want. I do not like writing a terrible review due to terrible customer service at the front desk.  However, the front desk took the position of me being rude when they cancelled my Open Table reservation stating they did not accept online reservations. Interesting how they were able to cancel the online reservation. They also made false statements about my language when they were being rude to everyone looking for a table.  Been there in the past and enjoyed dinner. Too bad a nasty attitude loses you business and negative reviews. It's full of old ladies (tías calientes)... Drinks are over priced, and well drinks are no longer 5 dollars. False advertisement...  Pre-game before or go somewhere else. Came on 11/21/12, bought the buffet of buffet deals (+$15/person for this Village Seafood Buffet).  There was no one at the line when we got there, which was good.    The waiter was very nice, and kept constantly refilling our drinks, which was very good.   Food quality is OK.  As other Yelpers have mentioned, for the price you pay, the cocktail shrimp should be without shells, but it isn't. Also, the shrimp are kind of small compared to other buffets of the same price.   There was lobster tails, scallops, oysters, and many other seafood cooked in different ways, but nothing tasted outstanding.   Sincerely, I was expecting something outstanding because this was all seafood, however it didn't surprise me at all.    I would not come back to this buffet, unless there is a substantial discount or a free meal or something like it, for this price, I will go to Bellagio. Have been here for about 3 years now and really enjoyed staying here. The staff is great and always there to help you with smiling faces! The location is great and very quiet neighborhood,  The pool is amazing and is very clean.  All of our maintenance requests have been taken care of on the same day. This is an "order at counter and they bring it to you" place. Very good sandwiches that are not run of the Mill. Four of us tried a different sandwich and shared. Each sandwich had it's own personality and pop of flavors. Portions are generous. Home brew tea is refreshing. Inside it's a bit loud with tall ceilings and hard surfaces. Outside seating is ample and nice.  Very clean place. I pleaded with the manager to bring Ncounter to Northern California. Nope. Said he'd expand in the southwest first, so I guess this one place I will put on my list each time I visit Tempe. On the weeklong trip to Calgary, this was my first stop for a lunch. Mirchi is a small casual dining restaurant in the downtown Calgary. It does not have its own parking but there is some parking close by on the street. Good things first, for a small place it is neat with nice decor. The service is fast, and the presentation great. Menu has a variety to chose from. I decided to try out goat karahi. I confess that it was a tricky dish to chose from because barring a handful almost all places in North America fail at it. And the it failed the authenticity test. Goat in Indian/Pakistani cuisine should not have that peculiar aroma that you commonly find in Mediterranean lamb or goat dishes. That said the garlic naan was really good so was the dessert, kheer. I will see if i decide to come back on this trip to try some other stuff and update the review. It's not very obvious what "Pop 'N Tea" is, so I wasn't sure what to expect walking into this place. I was pleasantly surprised to find tasty gelato bars, or diamond bars, I think they call them, in fun flavors such as coconut, matcha, and salted caramel. They are absolutely perfection and while they make for a great Instagram photo, they're also pretty delish. You can also add a chocolate dip (dark, milk or white) and a drizzle and pick two toppings from a wide array of nuts, cereals and more. There are also teas with some sort of boba, but not the traditional black ones you're thinking of. I just wish they'd add these to the menu and I'd be in love! Really great dumplings and flavor! I ordered the boiled pork, shrimp and cabbage, fried shrimp and vegetable dumplings, and garlic eggplant. The fried shrimp and vegetable dumpling was perfect and delicious. The boiled pork, shrimp and cabbage were a little bit salty but didn't bother me too much. The garlic eggplant was one of the best I had. The prices are reasonable and they were really nice to accommodate delivering outside of their zone for me! Would definitely be ordering again in the near future! We were just in Arizona visiting family and stopped by this Nutrishop.  The staff and owner of the shop greeted us, answered all our questions and spent time educating myself and my husband. Great experience!!! I wanted to respond to Aaron's review. That's because I'm likely the individual the server was sitting with. Just to clarify, that was at my request. I'm on my own these days, and on most evenings my company is the latest issue of Sports Illustrated. But at this particular Fleming's, where I generally dine once each week and am a Magnum member) I've become friendly with most of the people that work there. And on this particular evening, I asked the server to join me. Had this prevented her from being attentive to your party (which was not the case, as you noted), you'd have a legitimate complaint. As that wasn't the case, there was no lack of professionalism whatsoever. Fact is, while I really enjoy all the elements (food, service, ambience) at this Fleming's, it's the personal treatment that keeps me coming back. I thought this needed to be said. I cant give this clinic and Dr. Holt enough praise! this is the only place I bring my precious babies to.  The staff is attentive, understanding and loving! I know my babies are in perfect hands every time they arrive at Animal Kindness.    Dr. Holt without a doubt is the best Vet in Las Vegas.  He is loving, kind and gentle and provides the best care for my babies.  He's been taking care of my babies for more than 10+ years and will continue...you wont be disappointed! My Spanish is very basic. The maid knocked on the door and gave me a dirty look. I was waiting for the bell boy to get our bags. she said something in spanish and i asked "what?" She didnt answer and then all she said was "Seven" in English.  Overall, the stay was fine. The maid ticked me off and I don't ever treat Service personnel badly because that's how I put myself through college, and I know what how it feels, but her dirty look and attitude overtook my usual considerate nature. I think I was more offended because it was not my fault. The bellboy took 45 minutes to get to the room!!! The Distillery District is painfully pretty and charming in every corner, and The Stirling Room is no exception. Wooden beams, exposed brick and gothic charm plus a candlelit prohibition-era tunnel with bullet holes in the basement. Stunning.   This locale is only open on lounge-like nights and special occasions, and it's true... it has the ability to be a bit clubby, but with atmosphere this pretty, it attracts a mature crowd. Loosen up and check this place out, pals.   Full disclosure: I worked with this place for a Yelp event recently, but from top to tail it was an authentic planning experience, plus I've also been on my own time so want to shout them out. I've walked past this store for quite awhile and finally stopped in when my old pair of Birkenstocks decided to wear a hole in themselves. Amy helped me find a nice pair of oiled leather Birkenstocks in the proper size. They were comfortable from the moment I slipped them on.  Amy also explained that I could have my old Birkenstocks resoled and have the straps reconditioned. I'm seriously thinking about it because I loved my pair of purple suede Birkenstocks. I might change over to the classic sole instead. It is quite a bit more comfortable than the soft foot bed.   I like this store and the one to one customer service. This will be my go to walking shoe store. FYI, they'll be moving to the west side of Best of the West in a few weeks. Best place for steaks bar none. Every Sunday all steak 1/2 off. Great place to watch some football while you eat. I'm not a salad kind of guy but this place make great salads too. Everything on the menus are great! Finally, the real deal!  I met the owner and Chef, she's a sweetheart and a very good cook! The place was filled with Asians, which is a GOOD THING. If the people of it's own ethnicity are eating there, than you know it's a good staple of Korean Cuisine.   There's plenty of room to sit, and they start you off with KIM CHI, Cucumbers, and Boiled Peanuts for appetizers. Nice veggies to wet the palate. I had the Combo dish, which was outstanding!! Teriyaki Chicken, grilled Short Rib, and an Egg fried Steak over white rice served with the perfect Hawaiian Guava Passion fruit juice drink.   I tried my wife's dish which was the Spicy Pork with white rice. FIRE!! ABSOLUTE FIRE! Perfectly tender pork loin smothered in a spicy/sweet sauce. I tell ya, the taste of that had me smiling.   Customer service is VERY GOOD! They are all very helpful and fast, so please be ready to order!  I had made this rating a 4, and changed it to a 5. Because now that I'm writing this review, I want some more good food and good service.  Nice work guys!! I tried the brisket, tacos, ribs, grits, mexicorn, pulled chicken.  Now eveyrhing was great. My favorite things out of all of it was the grits and mexicorn. For me it was satisfying. The grits was rich and savory. The mexicorn was fun and flavorful. Service was great. The frontline was happy and attentive. Highly recommend this is place even though it's a gas station!!! LOL! The woman who books the cleaning appointments was incredibly rude with me. Given that she is in the service industry, she should re-think that way that she treats customers. In addition, I rarely had the same person clean my home, and the quality of cleaning was extremely variable. I would not recomment this service. I used to frequent Maya often, as the Japanese stylists were sweet and skilled; however, I cannot justify patronizing a salon with such poor management and service any longer. My main issue is with the individuals who run the place. Time and time again, my appointment times have not been honoured, and they were rude and condescending when I last broached the topic with them. This was the straw that broke the camel's back, and I will not be giving Maya the satisfaction of wasting my time anymore. I'm sure this was exciting for many people. I, however, could not wait for the torture to end. Too loud, uncomfortable chairs and sucky if you're not a Beatles fan. Maybe the "regular" cirque show would have been a more worthwhile experience.  Had to exit to ask an attendant for ear plugs so that I could rejoin my party and not appear rude. Worst MAC location ever!!! After repeated attempts and fails I am no longer returning to this MAC even though it is the closest to my house... I am even considering switching my holy grail eyeliner to another brand entirely as the people who work MAC counters generally look like street walkers (and not in a good way- if there is a good way!)- not edgy, like I think they are going for! They are lazy and you have to go over to them and get in their face to get them to help you and basically hand them the product. And then they don't even say 'hi' or ask 'how are you?'- you know, the bare minimum that is to be expected in ANY human intereaction- let alone a customer service interaction at a retailer where they want my money!  I used to spend tons at MAC and now I have moved on to more luxurious things and better service at the Chanel counter... though definitely not at this Dillards- the customer service is atrocious all over at this mall! I really don't know how some of these people have jobs.  Sorry if some of my reviews seem harsh lately, but I am no longer standing for this kind of crap service. I was charged nearly twice the amount for medication that I could have gotten much cheaper at a local pharmacy. Had I known how expensive Roadrunner pharmacy is, I would have requested the vet give me a prescription I could have taken to the local pharmacy in the first place. $110.35 for ten packs, vs $60.00 at local pharmacy.  The medication is for a chronic condition, so it must be given for the rest of my cat's life. I can guarantee you Roadrunner pharmacy has gotten their last dime from me. Anytime my cat needs medication I will see if I can buy it at the local pharmacy first, and if not, I will go to a competitor that I see advertised on television. This small, nondescript Bengali restaurant on the far end of Danforth is a total find. Absolutely amazing food, friendly patrons and and staff, and low prices.  Upon striking up a conversation with some other customers we learned this is one of the few places in the city to get true home cooked Bengali food. The mother of the family that runs the place apparently cooks the food just like she does for her family. And, after tasting the food, I believe it.  We didn't bother with the menu. Instead we just asked the young daughter of the owners to give us a sampling of their dishes, mostly the non meat ones. We ended up with an absolute feast.  To start we had lentil pakoras, a fried bread stuffed with lentils called dalpuri, and a chickpea-like dish with onions and potatoes called bwot. For mains we had a tasty spicy lentil soup, a vegetarian curry, and kacchi (beef) biryani, all served with delicious, fresh pratha.  Everything was good, but the kacchi was mindblowing. The rice in this dish had the most amazing subtle spicing. Not sure what was in there exactly but damn it was awesome. And extremely fresh. Only available on Friday though.  We finished with tea and a variety of desserts including a lovely pudding with caramel. I'm not huge on South Asian desserts but these were pretty good.  All this was easily enough to feed the four people in our group and we were shocked when the bill came in under $30. An unbelievable deal for this quality of food.  Recommended order: dalpuri, pratha, and kacchi biryani.  This place is the real deal! Go here now. This is my place to go when needing a massage. The place is lovely, the staff is amazing and never disappoints me. Stopped in today for breakfast and was so disappointed.  Not with the donuts - they are fine.  But we ordered a few other items that fell flat, and so did the service.   Here's the scoop: avoid the "wrap" breakfast sandwich.  The contents were indistinguishable.  I ordered egg white and turkey sausage and I got egg whites with something green in them.  The "wrap" is a small tortilla that is folded around the egg thing and is somehow baked or steamed.  It was gross and inedible.  We also got a chicken biscuit which was fine, as least as good as the donuts.  Two cooladas were ordered.  Both were nasty.  What a vile drink.  And finally let's chat about the service and the condition of the store.  Filthy kitchen area; many employees, and seemed only one or two had worked there more than a day.    I will not go back.  Hey, DD - stick to donuts or hire people who can count higher than 4 I've had some issues with CenturyLink internet services, but if you come to this store then work with Fabian! He's knowledgeable and genuinely helpful. Awesome burgers, great atmosphere, attentive wait staff.   Ordered the Lola Burger and I keep dreaming of it so I must return soon. Also got a custom alcohol milkshake (vanilla bean and apple pie with bourbon), that alone was one of the best mixtures I've ever had.  We arrived during lunch on a Monday and was immediately seated. After arriving, the place was packed.   It was my husband and I and he ordered the Porky burger and he is also very happy.  We complimented our lunch with Lola fries and onion rings...perfect lunch (not to mention our daughters name is Lola)!  Definitely a laid back atmosphere with awesome burgers (better than many places that state the same claim) and great beverages. I only wish it was closer to home! First time eating at Island Style, it won't be our last.  Good food, Uncle Russell treated us like we were family. If your from Hawaii this as close to any kine Korean from home. Who else offers meat Jun in LV.? Haven't found any till here. Combo plate n bulgugi / spicy seafood soup dinner are good. Will be back...Ono... Why only 5 stars?  Wouldn't let me give them 6!  OK, just saw this place, and had to try.  Ordered the half  dozen, where the person behind the counter picks them  out.  Only she let us pick most of them out.  The Maple  Bacon long john, was not a choice for that deal. So, we got 7 donuts, and all we've tried are simply  Amazing!  steve I was here several weeks ago for my young son's birthday. The food was great and the service was better. Our waitresses made sure all of my kids were happy and settled. She also joined us when we sang happy birthday to him. I will definitely be back soon! Great gluten free options for pizza and wings. The white pizza is amazing I have lived in the valley for 23 years and this is one of my absolutely favorite top 3 restaurants in the city. It's fast casual, chipotle style enchiladas but every ingredient is made from scratch right in front of you.   The food has incredible depth of flavor. Every component has been flawlessly executed every time I have been here.   The ambience is casual and often very crowded. The owner is almost always running around and is super friendly. This is the best nail spot in Shadyside hands down (and nails painted!). The staff is attentive and funny, and their work is superb. Prices are reasonable and you get more than you pay for! Have been buying Chinese BBQ pork here for almost 20 years. Chow fun also. Always delicious, always fast and friendly. Never had a bad experience in all 20 years. Thank goodness for an authentic Hong Kong style restaurant in Las Vegas. We just love it!! Un.Be.LIEVABLE. We had a reservation at 7 and they sat us promptly by the window so we could people watch. The vibe is casual yet somehow upscale. The décor reminds me of my mother's kitchen, comfortable with a touch of French attitude. The menu is fantastic and I wish we could have ordered everything. We did not feel like making our way multiple times to the chalk board which shows the menu. Our waiter was more than happy to give us appetizer and oyster suggestions and we went from there. The fried oyster appetizer was unmatchable. Three fried oysters assembled on top of a giant oyster shell had special sauce and lemons on top. The artichoke app was equally as impressive. I wish I knew the names of these dishes, but I was about 5 drinks in at this time. Of course my mom and I ordered the Lobster Spaghetti- after looking at everyone's pictures, you kind of have to. A Huge price tag comes along with this dish, however, the amount of lobster you are consuming is enough to feed the entire city of Montreal. I loved every bite of this dish and got more and more upset when my plate was becoming emptier and emptier (or I might have just gotten emotional from all of the wine).  The wine selection is never ending and the white that our waiter picked out for us was a perfect dry chardonnay. What was even better was that the couple next to us didn't finish their wine (that is unacceptable) and gave it to us. Their red was one of the best red's I have had.  I wish I could dine here every single night- yes. It was that good. And no, I'm not just saying that because I was intoxicated off of wine and good food all night. My wife and I have stopped here a couple time after moving recently. We have tried the loaded spuds (Brisket) , Salads, Burnt Ends and brisket sand-which with potato salad. The service is excellent and restaurant very clean from my experience. We really like the food I am a big fan of the brisket  and will definitely keep coming back and trying new items!! I visited this place with some friends to have brunch. I think it is a nice place with good staff.   They had a breakfast buffet, I think mostly for free breakfast patrons of hotel, but we opted for menu. It is a little overpriced for what they serve. My omelet was good but not exceptional for the price. Wait staff was very friendly. For tea, there is not much selection considering the price.   I would rather go to other reasonably priced places at walking distance next time I am there and I am paying out of pocket. I had my screen fixed here and the next day it cracked. They would not honor the 30 day guarantee. I would NEVER recommend this place. Poor customer service. Do not waste your money. Enjoyed the pizza very much, very creative process and the quality was actually worth the wait. Didn't think we would wait as long as we did, but in the end, glad we stuck around to enjoy it. Definitely eating here again. I went here for lunch today, craving a green chile burrito. No cars in front of me or behind me in drive-thru, but I had a semi-long wait. I was ok with that since most restaurants of the like make it fresh and it's worth it. Burrito was a great size for the price, the green chile sauce was okay. But the meat was dry and stringy and not saturated/infused with green chile as if it had been marinating all day, like it should. Maybe this is just not their winner and I'll try something different another time probably, especially since it's so close to my work. Only heard bad things about this place but was fighting a hangover and you know what that means....time to get my pho on. Ordered the number 3. The broth was flavorful but I still added a bit of hoisin sauce. Because its hoisin sauce duh. The meet was nice and tender with good flavor. The bowl was very filling. But it was a little pricy for pho but then again it is Vegas so whatevs. Solid choice to get rid of that headache. This show was great! The only thing is that they only really pay attention to bachelorettes/ birthday girls which is kind of disappointing because the majority of the crowd is not one of the two. However, me and my friend still had a blast & fell in love with the sexy dances! Recommended for a girls night out! Definitely pay extra for the VIP tables, that's where they spend 95% of their time dancing! This place has a lot of great things going on. When you enter through the doors you might get a second thought about ordering food from what appears to be a mini mart for noodles and other random trinkets; don't be an idiot! Stay in line and get something,..anything,..it is all good.  I absolutely enjoyed their cheese steak sandwiches. The Italian sodas were always refreshing and they have so many other things.   Take a second to read the owners story it adds to the reason you will like this place. I come here often for dimsum with my gf and her family.  It's a very nice restaurant and the decor is grand and well put together.  The place looks fancy from the dining area to the washrooms.  All I see walking around is gold trim and elaborate carvings on the walls and floors.  I mainly come for dimsum, but the dinner menu is clean and really well cooked.  The fish is usually very fresh and there are many choices on the menu to fit anyone's needs.  The dimsum menu is nice and the food tastes amazing.  After 1:30-2pm is also the cheap dimsum menu so you can save a bit if you eat later.  My favourite items are the staple rice cakes in banana leaf, siew mai and deep fried squid tentacles.  The tea is also nice and refreshing and the servers are prompt in refilling your tea pots!  Overall I really enjoy coming here and like the atmosphere and food.  They also have a nifty points card to allow you to trade for toys, appliances, rice bags or discounts off your next meal! Holy crap I am never doing this airline again! I know with budget airlines, you get what you pay for but this airline is beyond terrible and needs a lot of improvement. There are fees tacked on for everything and you have to be careful with what you are doing. This is my first time taking Allegiant and usually we take United Airlines. My mother and I took Allegiant to Las Vegas from Colorado Springs and we weren't expecting much after reading all of the other reviews. My disabled mother was not able to get her carry on into the overhead bins and asked a flight attendant for help. The flight attendant's response was to "do it yourself". Flight attendants are supposed to help those in need! Our flight was late leaving the gate, seats would not recline on the MD-80, they did an inflight beverage service but charged for every damn thing you would normally get for free such as orange juice and water. There wasn't any snacks, speakers were way too loud and we had an even crappier experience at the Las Vegas airport. We bought the shuttle thing to take us to and from the airport for about $30. People around us said they got it for $12. Our paper said nothing about the shuttle, where we were supposed to go, what shuttle looks like, etc. We waited a very long time for the shuttle! We were told by one of the employees that we were going to the Hilton Elara and to get into line 2, he later told us the bus was approaching and to go to line 1. The driver looked at our papers and told us we were in the wrong line and line 2 is the one we want. Very aggravating that so much went wrong with everything that had to do with Allegiant. I might do a budget airline again but never Allegiant, they are so disorganized and rude. They don't know what good customer service is, and I am warning everyone I know about them! This place is awesome for waxing. Of course it hurts, you're getting a wax, not a massage! Every waxer I've had has been professional and talkative. Which I like because it takes my mind off the pain. You walk in and are greet immediately, unless they are on the phone and they will at least make eye contact to make sure you are acknowledged. The store is very clean and trendy. Prices are a little bit high but you get what you pay for. I recommend this place! I needed a large truck after purchasing a new set of furniture, so I went to Adens Hay Oasis, aka U-Haul, on Williamsfield.  The kid behind the counter, a local cowboy (no joke), was helpful in making sure they had a truck for us the next day. I got there early the next morning before they were open. After waiting a few minutes for the 2 kids to set out the horse and pig feed (next to the chicken coop in the parking lot) outside for the day, I was helped a few minutes early and sent on my way. The truck I received was in excellent shape (for a moving truck), and actually enjoyable to drive. Returning the truck was quick and painless. Now I know where to go locally for a quick moving truck..... and also pot belly pig feed, spurs, and horse accessories. They are a family of friends,this place will treat you as one of there own.They are fast,convient,and a team of professionals. I would recommend any one who wants polite and prompt service. Very disappointing. Walked in when the patio was empty. Asked for a table for 2. Advised of a 20 minute wait based on reservations. 45 minutes later we still had no table and the patio was empty. Their employee randomly took my number from their appointment book and started messaging me and harassing me.    I mean they did a pretty good job dyeing my hair,  the cut was a little choppy. Not sure if I would come here again. Friends and I decided to try out an Indian restaurant closer to our place rather than trek up to the reliably tasty Bombay Mahal. Big mistake. The waiter seemed annoyed at our requests (e.g., an order of channa with our samosas) and got a few things wrong, even though we clarified in both English and Hindi. The sauces were bland and overly oily, the paneer was dry (almost hard, really) and strangely sweet, and most of the dishes tasted the same. The best thing was actually the plain basmati rice. Next time we'll be going back up to Jean-Talon, even in a snowstorm. Good value, really tasty. Friendly family run affair. Eaten here a handful of times and have never been disappointed. A couple of the dishes are a little on the oily side, but to be expected from this type of chinese food. A welcome addition to Little Italy... definitely worth checking out! I don't usually review a gas station/convenience store, but after my poor experience at the Vans Golf Store next door to this, I felt inclined to write a review of the Superpumper.   I got a flat tire in my truck, and my 6 y.o. grandson was with me. We pulled into the first available parking lot (Vans), called AAA, and went inside to hopefully wait since it was 110 degrees out. But the Vans employees were so rude, telling us we couldn't "loiter" inside. I reminded them that I had a small child with me, and it was very hot. They just said SORRY.   so I went back outside, drove my truck with its very flat tire next door to the Super Pumper and called AAA to update our location.   The employees in the convenience store were VERY nice, allowing us to wait inside instead of outside in the heat.   A simple gesture of kindness makes all the difference!!! I purchased a GroupOn as a gift for my wife who has always wanted to learn to knit.   .  My wife loved the store and the environment that seems to foster learning and group project help.    She attended the basic knitting class.  The class was a well sized group of 8 students and the instructor gave very personalized instruction and training to every student..  She was organized, patient and cognizant of the fact that this was a basic knitting class where for many if not all students this was their first experience at knitting.  This is truly a great example of a wonderful small business that puts the customer first. Can't get a drink here after 15 minutes of trying on an early Friday afternoon, but you can get lots of 'tude for pointing out why you're leaving. We had such a great experience from our server leah to our busser aj.  We would highly recommend to anyone that is looking for a great dinning experience.  We will definitely return. We had a family get together and the food was delicious! Our server, Maegan is the best there is! She is personable and on top of things! We really enjoyed our time there and will do it again and definitely ask for her! Jeff is absolutely great and so knowledgeable!  Great to go if you really want to make something unique and custom for you. Beds don't fit Canadian mattresses. We have been completely misled and have been trying to return a bed back to the store for a week and Muji has been asking us to pay for returning the bed! Calls are not answered, messages are not returned and staff don't seem to know what mujis operating procedures are  Update - 9 months later Muji refuses to refund me the pick up money owed. Additionally Muji claimed that dimensions in store, catalog and online are for "guidance" only when there was no commentary like that anywhere The Aloft in Beachwood is a newer, Euro style hotel, rooms are clean, beds comfy, nice shower and over layout....so why two stars... Unruly kids given the run of the hotel, it took an irate customer to blast them at 2 am to finally stop marathon of activity  Where is the hotel management? This place was where the gino pizza use to be. Right across the street from square boys. Tough competition but I got say I did like this places burger better.  I had the red dice burger which is regular burger but cheese melted into bun on both side. Sound good. They have 4 and 6 but it's only about dollar between the two size and whole meal with the combo was 10 dollars.   Now I know what you are thinking if it cheap food, can't really be special. It was flavorful and good. I would eat it again. I also had a slice of pizza, and it was good. I think everything is homemade. Including the chicken wings which I have yet to try.  This place has a wide selection but so far between the pizza and burger I loved it and its a good value. I guess squarebiy will have to take a backseat to this place, atleast in my books. Being a California native, I didn't try Fatburger until we moved to Vegas. Sad, eh? I'm so glad I finally tried this place! love LOVE their burgers and fries.   So, it's looks are deceiving. It looks closed due to the lack of customers whenever I pass by. But they are open! We visit this place about once a month, as a treat. The staff is always super nice and chill. The burgers are always cooked to perfection and put together neatly with the fixins! I usually order the small fat with skinny fries. I have tried the onion rings, and they were delicious, but it started to be too much to eat after I finish a delicious fatburger.   I learned that this chain is in each Station casino, minus Boulder Station. I haven't visited those locations. I'm really glad this location isn't too far from our apt. :) They have a frequent visitor card thing. You get a stamp for each fatburger you purchase, and it's double stamps on Tuesdays. Fill up a card and you get a free Fatburger! I haven't read the fine print, but I'm saving our full cards for a lazy day :) Their pizza is awesome! I love their dough. You can't really go wrong with any of the items on the menu. The staff is very friendly as well. Horrible! Had to leave as soon as we saw the room. Dead roaches on the bench/couch by window. Made a face when we told them we didn't wanna stay and wanted our money back. They were rude. Unorganized. And filthy rooms. I strongly suggest to not even think about staying there. Deserves no stars because it's really a crappy place. Wow, guess my review was a bit premature.  I'm now going thru a similar experience with James G.'s review of 3/1/18.  I believe his story is spot on since encountering my own grief with the billing dept. of this office.  I spoke with Michael too, at exit of my last cleaning using their 12 month $299 plan, on 2/28/18.  He gave me options going forward for the 2 plans they offer and he said "NO NEED to choose one now since I don't have a cleaning scheduled till 5/31/18."  He said "the plan is 12 mos so you'll waste 3 mos of that waiting till 5/31/18."  I knew this already and was not going to choose either plan that day.  He made NO mention of needing to sign a letter rejecting an automatic renewal of that plan [which I was totally unaware of] by the next day 3/1/18.  Lo and behold, when paying my Capital One card Sunday 3/11/18 I see Cherrington Dental charged me $299 on that very next day, 3/1/18, without my consent.  Not only that, they DID NOT send me a receipt for that $299, so I had no idea it was done.  Had I not gone over my charges as usual I would have missed it.  Pretty low down sneaky and rotten thing to do to a patient of 1 year!  Where was the question, do you want to renew for another year, or change plans?  Or, will you have insurance this year??  Questions never asked.    This is supposed to be a dental practice helping/caring for patients.  So, I called the Dental office and was told by Angie that Michael & Tammy were busy, that no charge reversal would be done, and that I would receive a return call that afternoon - 3/13/18.  Of course, no call came 3/13 or 3/14, so today 3/15/18 I called Capital One to start a dispute to reverse this nonsense.  Now we've had 4 days of grief in our house due to this, and I'm out a perfectly fine hygienist with a need to find another Dental office.  To anyone reading I would, and now have to, look elsewhere for a Dental office that earns my trust. Took my daughter to celebrate her passing the second block of nursing school with our entire family, the service was out of this world. The owner came over to introduce &'congratulate her, few minutes later comes to hand her a baskets of their famous garlic knots as a token of grangratulaions! Then, he brought us all sampler of their dessert balls after we finished our meal. Just amazing service overall. Now, as far as the food...it totally matched the 5-star service we received. We ordered the Alfredo, wow, never in my life have we had alfredo taste that delious! We also order three x-large pizza pies...best way to eat these bad boys is right out of the oven...unbelievable experience and taste!!!! The milk teas are great, both cold and hot! I had the shrimp burger, Malaysia's bone soup noodle, and sandwiches, they all taste pretty good. The soup base is very close to what I had in Malaysia before, but the herbal taste is not very strong, still give it a like! I avoided seeing a doctor because I didn't want surgery.  Dr Kastrup did my hip surgery and all I can say is good things about him. He prepared me for what to expect, the surgery was easier than I was expecting and I was amazed at my progress.  The office always seems busy but I blame that on them being good at what they do and the state of our overburdened healthcare system.  My wife has seen Dr Song for several different problems, most recently a fractured humerus and while paperwork seems to lag behind, treatment doesn't. A most excellent company to deal with.  They respond to e-mails and phone calls right away.  The workers are very professional, both Isaac (the person who did the initial inspection) and Josh (the person that did the treatment) were very polite and courteous.  I would definitely recommend this company. Called this company based on reviews and was very pleased. Robert came out and worked on my toilet. He fixed that in no time but had to reschedule work I needed done on an exterior shutoff valve because he didn't have a needed part. He told me I didn't need to pay for the toilet work until he came back and finished the exterior work. Nice. The work for shutoff valve required redoing and replacing piping so took some time. But he did a great job and I was happy with the work and his professionalism. It was a bit expensive, but he was here for a total of ~2hrs. I would use this company again, because they know what they are doing and are very efficient. Great pub! Only request...get new dart boards. The old ones must go! Please make this happen. Thank you I believe this small coffee shop is suffering from the economic slow-down, which is a shame. The offerings are nothing spectacular but I hate to see locally-owned businesses suffer. I have been in the shop about 5 times in the last couple weeks at what should be peak times, but the place was dead and often I was the only customer. Being set so far back from Gilbert Rd. probably isn't helping their cause.  Their signature drink the Shark Bite is your basic caffeine-infused cold beverage. If you like coffee and you need a shot of caffeine, you will find none better. However their menu is difficult to follow - you're kind of on sensory overload when your standing there at the counter and the guy is waiting to take your order. Still, service is good and they are friendly.  The shop has a small conference room which is great for conducting small meetings or interviews, if you don't mind the Christmas tree box in the corner. They also have massage chairs, computer workstations and free Wi-Fi. If you're looking for somewhere to spend your  money other than Starbucks, the Coffee Cove is a good option for you. Very delicious place. The Prix Fixe Menu is a good deal! I tried their pork chop dish and between that and the appetizer, this was way too much food for me (perfect for the boys though). We were here for a birthday dinner and they give a free small cake to the birthday person as well. It was a nice touch. Service was excellent. This is my wonderful experience to share with you! First I ask friend to suggest for reliable and expert skill dentist I need. She provide "Happy Dental" which are away from my house 30 min driving range(I am live in Henderson)! But, Saturday morning, after my wife and I walk into the front office, the first impression to me is: I am a walk-in and new patient buy they already have clear info and verify my insurance ready! This is the fast speed For my dental experience ever have. As they're so busy for existing patients, within 10 min they are ready for let my wife and I get into room and start X-ray & checking and cleaning. Dr. Andy and all assistance are showing happy, passion and professional attitude that makes me feel comfortable and pleasure time doing all process. This is the right place for my family to visit next time with our teeth health . Best suggestion and share! A friend had got me take out from this place. He'd gotten me the shawarma plate with the chicken and beef. And boy was I happy.   The meat to veg ratio was great! I love the fact that they hadn't tried to cheap out on the meat.   Second the amount of veggies were amazing. I for one need veggies and this was great. What I would have to say is that there is A LOT of rice. But to be fair it was flavourful and quite yummy.  Overall I'd definitely recommend what I had. I'm not sure about the sandwiches but Id def be back to give it a try. The plate can easily feed two; but if you've got a monstrous appetite; you'd want to have it for yourself.   Also cannot comment on the restaurant itself as i've never been. But for the food alone; def worth take out. I came here for oil change. Service is really terrible. I am seating and waiting right now, very uncomfortable. The way they talk to me, so rude. What is going on here? I think all workers here hate their jobs. After getting over my initial disappointment about this place (as I was picture Hot Yam! as a group of students cooking yams in tinfoil on a BBQ... and I love yam), I realized that I had found a Wednesday lunch gem, just minutes from where I work!  Hot Yam has a lunch weekly, at only FOUR DOLLARS for a starter, entrees and dessert! On my first visit, they were out of one item, making it a THREE DOLLAR LUNCH (!!!) that was filling, vegan, local, and delicious!   Now I'm not going to lie to you and say this is a fancy place. If you're looking for glamor or to impress someone, this isn't the place for you, BUT if you are looking for quality food and an amazing price, this is your place.   It's kind of like a cafeteria, in that you pay at the front, and wait at a table for the servers to bring our plates. You then grab a plate of your choice, cutlery, and try and find a seat amongst the students (if you're lucky!) it's often packed, so the to-go option might be better!   If you're looking for me on a Wednesday between 12 - 2, you know where to find me. Such nice surprise!  After going to recommended furniture decor warehouses that were disappointing with the quality available and customer service, I googled and found the best source for quality pre-owned furniture.  Will be shopping here a lot more! Used to be a 4 stars for me but I noticed a decrease in the quality of meat used for the steak burrito, which made it hard for me to decide to go back... which I still do once in a while. I guess if you go after a night out you won't notice that difference as much...  Bonus point: Love that they keep a stack of NOW newspaper... the only place in the city I would check it out while having a burrito. Out of all the restaurants I've been to in Vegas, I must say....Sushi Samba is probably the best one I've eaten at!    Though the food isn't cheap and the portions aren't big.....everything that I ordered was delicious and well worth the money.  I would recommend everything I ordered for those that are going there.   Here's what I ordered for 2 people: 1) sea bass and miso antichucos....the Peruvian corn that comes with it was quite tasty 2) agedashi tofu....3 fried tofu, 1 asparagus and 1 mushroom in some sort of sauce.  this was probably the most normal item that we ate on the menu....but it was still good. 3) bobo brazil samba roll.  this was quite interesting...seared kobe beef roll. 4)  some sort of spicy tuna roll.  the tuna was high quality...VERY FRESH! 5) Peruvian hot chocolate....this was DAMN good!  The drink was thick and very creamy. 6) Mango honey crisp taquito.    thinking of the food makes me drool wishing i could have it again.   the service there was EXCELLENT!  waiters clean your table and fill your water before you even have to ask.  they were very attentive and not smothering.  BE AWARE though...right when you sit down they ask you if you'd like some edamame.  you think this would be free....but you will later find out that you're being charged for it.    Sushi Samba is a definite must! Delicious. You should expect a line when you get here, but it moves quickly and is worth the wait. Try the orange juice and the biscuits! Noodle Asia is located in the Venetian casino, on first floor near all the slot machines!  The previous day, I was sightseeing, walking through the casino, and NA caught my eye!  They have a menu outside their front doors and I observed it.  Well, I saw that they have Pho!!! I loooove Pho and it is difficult to find in my hometown area.  So right away, I knew I already wanted to come back and try it.  When I got back to my hotel, I read a few Yelp reviews and saw pictures from my fellow Yeeps Ken L and Mike O.   I came back next day, before opening 11am Monday morning.  I got there 15 minutes early and a line was already forming!  I think I was the 4th person and by the time they opened, I am sure there were at least 30 people waiting.  I got the impression that this was a great sign and people in line were ready to get in and order lunch!!  The restaurant is very open area, lots of space, and nice decor.  I liked it very much and felt comfortable seated at my table.  There are lots of tables and I also saw a counter area.   My server came over and took my order.  I still looked over the menu while I was waiting and there are soooo many items on there that I would love to try, but I specifically came back for the "Pho Prime".  OK, this is the most Expensive Pho I have ever bought at $16.95.  I normally pay 7-8$ for a bowl at other places in Nor Cal.  But that being said, I really didn't care about the price, if I want something, I buy it and plus I was on vacation in Vegas... have to Enjoy every moment to the fullest :)  The Pho Prime was Delicious.  It had a great flavor in the broth, lots of meats, lots of noodles, and I enjoyed eating it  BUT, No Hoisin sauce, it didn't come with my plate so I asked for it and my server said they ran out yesterday??  The Pho Prime is a huge bowl too, I could not finish it.  It was definitely worth the price and place!  My server was OK, and she was busy with other tables as well.  I was disappointed I couldn't order a dessert, 3 of 4 choices that I wanted to try on the menu were out!!!  At first I almost didn't believe it lol, like for real?  I really wanted to order the Hawaiian Papaya :/  so I decided not to get a dessert, changed my mind.  Then it took awhile for me to get the bill, I was waiting...  Overall, I had a very good lunch and Yes, I would definitely return!  Considering the location, how much I like the Venetian casino, and all the menu options that I read sounded tasty.  Hopefully, the next time I am in town I can come in and order a big dinner.  This is a great place for couples or groups, plenty of seating.  I left fulfilled and satisfied that I got my Pho ;) We probably eat more at Wolfgangs than any other place inside MGM. Always really good chow and service. Thanks folks. Well done. Hands down my favorite fish store in the valley! I like it because they have a great blend of everything you need - fish, coral, hardware, tanks etc and a super friendly staff. Clean displays and lots to choose from. I love coming here because it's always a very inviting atmosphere. A bartender at the Bellagio suggested I try this place if I was looking for amazing Hawaiian food. Him being a Hawaii native, I took his word and decided to try it out.   Russell and Gina are one of the nicest couples you will ever meet. Russell comes over and greets you with some boiled peanuts which are so addicting. We always order the combo and fried rice omelet which tastes amazing. My most recent trip my combo plate was a little too salty, but I didn't want to speak up. I'm so happy for them that they expanded into the space next door vs how small their place was when I first started going there. Best hospitality in town you feel like you're practically family!! I've been to Honey Salt many times. I used to enjoy this place very much. I feel like Honey Salt was much needed to the Summerlin area. The last 3 times I've been there the waiters are lacking in customer service and never wait on you (no asking how your food is or if you need anything). I feel a SNOBBY vibe when I go here now and before it was very comfortable. The food is NOT CONSISTENT. I've had the scallops when they have been amazing and I've also had them when they have been rubbery. Whenever I order the grain power salad it's never consistent in portion size, the last time I took it to go, it wasn't enough food for a child, also the dressing sometimes has no flavor. For the prices they are charging (And NOT ORGANIC) I at least want my portion size to be consistent and the flavor to be amazing every time. I've also seen many times waiters or a random person garnishing the food with there bare hands and I don't think it's sanitary. I will give Honey Salt another try, but not for a while. I love this place, such a gem!  I have been by it so often when getting my eyelashes done and always wanted to stop in.  Finally, my boyfriend and I stopped in and I wish I would have done it sooner.  It was SO GOOD!  I even convinced my family to drive out from Chandler and they were raving about how good it was.  Right now, I am trying to get my boyfriends butt moving faster so I can fulfill my Italian craving lol.  I will be a regular!    Who am I?  I am a total foodie, who has had the privilege to travel the world and eat at small gems!  I have had the luxury of eating at stalls in hawker centers in Singapore to Three Star Michelin restaurants, like Guy Savoy in Paris.  I have also been all around Italy and ate at the non-tourist gems.  This reminded me of being back in Italy! My gf suggested we eat here because they have "better" food, which I suppose is implied by the higher price they charge for dinner.   This is not the case.   When you're in Vegas (or anywhere, really) you have to remember that a buffet is a buffet is a buffet.   Sure, they've got Kobe (not really, we aren't in Japan) beef, lamb, sushi, Alaskan king crab legs, snow crab, flank steak, shrimp cocktail...  ... but it all tastes like buffet quality food, which is a better way of saying they're mostly terrible.   Do you know how difficult it must be to coordinate a meal big enough to feed hundreds, if not thousands, or people? Do you possibly think quality can be a factor in cooking these meals?  Where is the satisfaction in getting a thick slice of Kobe beef if it's so tough your knife can't get through it?  Like king crab legs? Then you'll hate them here, since they're all machine-cut, partially frozen, and it tastes like they've been sitting in a salt water bath for a week.   I wouldn't even mess with the sushi. I'm very, very picky about my fish, and whatever they were serving here looked one step above the grocery store.   Even the desserts were mediocre.   If you want to eat well in Vegas, go look up a decent restaurant and drop the $70 you'd spend here there. This last (and I do mean LAST) buffet visit proved once and for all that no matter what they're serving or charging, nothing beats paying for freshly made food. It isn't worth cramming sub-par servings down your gullet just to justify the cost of what you paid to get in here. Unless you have no discerning tastes, or you're just a big fatty who loves to binge eat (hey, no judgment here... do your thing) then this just isn't the place to waste money in Vegas. Incredibly interesting menu items! Their pear bread they use for the grilled cheese it really good, and their salads are also well balanced and delicious. Generous portion sizes. Service was a bit slow, but I'm not knocking points because I think they were a bit short-staffed that night and because our waitress was incredibly accommodating: she even had a salad remade for me when I forgot to ask for some things left off. Really trendy and cute location, outdoor seating area is nice, shaded, and has misters. Took my car here yesterday to get some repairs done. They were much cheaper than the dealer and had great customer service. they asked several times if I needed a ride to work after I dropped my car off and then again to pick it up. They have a very friendly staff!   Side note, don't avoid this place because it looks fancy and expensive, building and signage look great and the prices are very fair. I won't take my car anywhere else. I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap with fries and it was pretty good. The portion was large enough to completely satisfy. Chicken was well seasoned and veggies fresh. Just wish the sauces were a bit stronger or more flavourful to amp up the taste of the wrap. Love that they are open late too! Overall it was a good meal. I dream about the sham platter! One of the most inspired takeaway restaurants we have had in a long time. Everything is so fresh and flavourful, the staff is friendly and the prices are amazing. I just had dinner at Chris's new restaurant. I was not impressed. I have been dinning at His other restaurants for years and was underwhelmed by the Italian Restaurant.   We were disapointed that the servings were really small but good. We had the spagheti pomodoro. We were also very disappointed that the chocolate cake they serve was the same as they serve at Pan Bianco and it was three dollars more.   The service was ok but did not care too much for the hostess. She was some what unpolished. I did not care too much for the communal table, it reminded me of Chipotle grill. the atmosphere was noisey and echoed a lot.   I will probably try the Italian restaurant again. Very tasty homemade ice cream , and the sweetness of the Milo Dino just right, remind me of my childhood So excited to have a new (and unique!) restaurant on St. Clair West.  We had the halibut and chips, and both were delicious.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and the batter was light and crispy.  The fish to batter ratio was perfect.  There were far too many fries for one person to manage - next time we will go with the two piece and share the fries.  The decor is fun (ship inspired + upcycled church fixtures) and the staff are really friendly - we will definitely be back soon!!  Thanks Sea Witch, for anchoring on St. Clair! What can I say what hasn't been said before. A great brewery in NODA that has quality pints and free peanuts and sometimes live music. A lot of the time they have guest taps to share the joy of drinking my friends. King of PoPs and Noda Brewery is right next door. Some might call it Utopia when you add a BBQ food truck into the mix! And management allowed a worker to place her stuff all over a counter and fight with me because I took a picture of the garage sale going on in this restaraunt. This girl had serious issues and if this is the management style then new management is needed to be replaced also. I paid for my shake, never drank it and went on my way. Not sure if the owners read this but they need a serious talk with the staff of this place. Feel free to contact me if you want all the issues. This experienced my family and I had today was outrageous the food was cold undercooked and when you send it back the waitress got annoyed The Bloomin Onion well what can I say I don't know what they've done with it but it's not anything what it was before it'll be a long time before we step foot in this place again if ever the biggest part of this is they don't care. If you're spending $150-200+ per couple at night and want to throttle back on food spending, check this lunch place out.  Wife and I were staying at the Palazzo so on a suggestion we wandered over to the Fashion Show Mall and up to the Food Court (3rd floor).  Food Court just a slight level above most but not that much to look at.  The Habit was our destination.  I wanted to try the Santa Monica burger they were known for.  It didn't disappoint.  Good sized burger (I only finished half) w/ advocado on grilled sourdough.  Wife got the salad that was a special seasonal item (edaname, added tuna, etc).  She really liked it.  All sandwiches come with fries.  Soft drinks are all you can drink.  Service was quick and pleasant.  Restaurant and seating area was very clean.  Price for lunch was under $25 for two people.  Very good by Vegas standards. Awesome food and cheap prices. Such great quality. One of the only and best authentic japanese restaurants in az. We went there for my best friends bachelor party and had an amazing time! Brittany and James were very friendly and took care of us!! I highly recommend it but the only thing i didn't like was that we were told we had all you can drink top shelf liquor which was not completely true...they are mixed drinks. We will be back and thanks a lot again!!! I've been coming here for years and have never left with a bad hair cut.  I had Shanna today with a last minute appointment, and it's one of my favorite haircuts I've had in years.  She is young, but super skilled. I went here to eat and drink with my aunt and uncle. We sat at the bar and service was good. We felt that the food was excellent, especially for sushi in Wisconsin. We really enjoyed the soft shell crab appetizer and the nigiri. Price was very reasonable and draft beer was large! Great lunch place for a burger, fries and a coke. Fast service, friendly staff, 50s diner atmosphere, clean. Recommend the Cowboy burger if you're in the mood to indulge. My 'go to' burger place in this locale. we happened upon Olive & Ivy while touring scottsdale yesterday, and needed a lunch spot quick (we love to eat, and when we get together, its basically an eating festival).  we took a look at the menu and decided to go for the cheaper option of the counter service were i got a $7 salad of mixed greens, two cherry tomatoes and an ice cream scoop of tuna.  it was okay. it did the trick.  my friend ate a curry chicken pita which looked excellent and which she enjoyed.    our server/cashier girl was very nice and suggested a drink that my friend tried and liked. and she was quick with the service, so all in all, a good experience. i wouldn't particularly call this place mediterranean, but it's definitely targeting rich people who care about having 8 different brands of bottled water to choose from. This is a very small no frills and it gets super busy and crowded on weekends and the day before stat holidays. As its a smaller location, they don't have the same selections as some other no frills locations.  They have many restrictions on price matching policy (have to have paper flyers, and only certain stores) so don't even bother This little gem is best kept a secret even if it's been around for 18 years!! Delicious Vietnamese subs with fresh toppings on crispy but moist French baguette. My favorite is the beef sate but they are all good.Lovingly prepared by friendly owners and reasonably priced. Don't forget to bring cash and be prepared for a lineup but well worth it. I want to spread the word but don't want their popularity to change what is so good. This is my go-to when I don't bring lunch to work as it is just across the street from me. It is a quaint little place, with authentic Turkish dishes made fresh every day. I gave it 4 stars just because I noticed that the portions are much smaller now than it was when it first opened. They also stopped making the orangey rice that I loved. However, I love how tender the chicken is--the meat falls off the bone. If you're ever in the area, you should give this place a try. It is quiet, has amazing food and the servers are really accomodating. Plus, they have Turkish coffee! On the recommendation from a fine dining and steak connoisseur(actually, a comedian's message board from the man himself, but the dude has exhibited good taste in the past...) I took my wife to N9NE at the tail end of May.  I was ill-prepared to be well-dressed as it was vacation, but not only did they seat us with courtesy but had no problems getting us in on last-minute reservations.  Stewart, our table assistant, was excellent in handling explanations and service for my wife and I.    The food lived up to billing - from beginning to end, from salads to steaks to desserts.  The meat was prepared to spec, and required no additional seasoning or additives - nor was it over-prepared or over-salted.    At the end of the night, the bill was more reasonable than I expected.  All staff was courteous and friendly from the time we entered the facility to our departure.  N9NE is on my planned stopping point in January when I go back for a conference.  And I'll ask for Stewart. This is as good as Jewish food gets around these here parts! I just enjoyed my umpteenth Corned Beef Reuben sandwich here and want to report that this is the place to take your Jewish friends and relatives from out of town. Unlike Chompie's, the food is authentic, it is not wildly overpriced for touristas and it's not crowded. The wait staff is very friendly and accommodating. The Scottsdale location is open and airy and very laid back. Only complaint might be that they need to get some of their booths reupholstered because the cushions have worn out! Service is terrible.   There were 2 of us, the hostess sat us with only one menu. After we had to take turns to share the menu, we finally decided on our entrees. 30 minutes passed, no one ever approached the table so we decided to leave. On our way out I wanted to let the hostess know that we were never greeted, after which she asked "what table number were you at?" How am I supposed to know? Is it a requirement to know your table number in order to get waited on? Campfire sauce is great with the fries. Monster style also great. Wrap Burger in lettuce to save calories. I was quite disappointed with it. Water all mucky, not much greenery or botany. Even if you do want to go for a stroll, it's very small.   I don't know, maybe I came at the wrong time? Wasn't worth the drive and looking for parking.. I am so thankful we stumbled upon this beautiful restaurant. We are lovers of Indian cuisine and I must say we just ate the best Indian food ever. The flavors were unique and delicious. The meat was so tender and fresh. The portions were perfect. Everything felt light and healthy.  The service was better than Ive ever experienced. We ate at closing time and every employee had a huge smile on their face. The manager and chef took the time introduced themselves. I was blown away by their desire to make our night special.  This was truly a dining experience like no other, from start to finish. Id give 6 stars if I could. Wow, what a disappointment!  We often find Yelp to be a great tool in aiding our search for good places to visit.  Well, this time the Yelp reviews led us astray!  One of our dinners was very, very salty.  Yuk.  We decided to split the salad with the poached egg on it -- thought that would be interesting.  It was -- the egg was RAW.  We questioned the waitress about it and she explained that ti was poached. Well, yea, it was, sorta.  But does poached mean there would be uncooked egg white and yolk running over the salad?  A fellow, seemingly "in authority" stopped by with the full expectation that we would lavish complements on the establishment.  We also told him about the problem.  No response -- he moved on.    The beer list was minimal and undistinguished and the wine list was extensive.  Both wine and beer were v-e-r-y expensive for an undistinguished  little joint in a strip plaza.  I have never paid $6 for a 12oz bottle of beer before.    So, here's our score ... Food quality:  2.5 - 3 Food quantity:  3 Food value:  3 Beverage variety: 2 Beverage value: 1 Service: 2 Ambiance: 3  Would we return?  Not a chance!  We'll leave it to others to heap praise on this place -- while we will avoid it and advise others to do so as well. So growing up in LA al pastor was my favorite taco. I have not anything even close to home. BAM tacos chiwas nailed it. I cant get enough and the frijoles charros are amazing. Simple like nana used to make. Come here now wow I generally think buffets are a waste of money. I mean, how many plates of food can one eat? I was with my five other girlfriends after a long night of drinking and gambling. We needed some food.  The food spread is impressive. There is really something for everyone here... breakfast, lunch and dinner foods. I stuck with the eggs benedict, shimp cocktail and some fruit, but between the six of us, we had a good sampling of food.   The dessert section is out of control. Crembrulee, eclairs, chocolate raspberry ganace cake, profiteroles... they have it all. Next time, I will stick to this section only :) Triple M accountants are very knowledgable, professional, trust-worthy and get the job done right! You will truly have peace of mind having them handle your taxes!! 5-star service all the way!! Great place. Questionable from the outside as plain; but once inside, it is perfect. Clean, great layout, beautiful employees that do a magnificent job. Would definitely recommend and would go back for sure. I got a male pedicure and my wife and friend received mani-pedis. I've been bringing both my dogs to this hospital for about a year and a half.  Every time I go in, it is such a great experience. The staff and Veterinarians are always very helpful and patient with my babies. My boy Duke isn't always friendly with other dogs and for this reason the staff is very attentive towards us. I especially want to thank the receptionist Britany, she always makes us feel at ease and I see her with other customers as well treating them with the same courtesy she does us. I am sure all other customers feel the same I do...thank you Boca Animal Hospital!! I shop this store frequently. I have a 1 month old baby and discovered clicklist! So happy hey offer it here now. The in store experiences I've had are fantastic, from deli to cashiers and all departments! The clicklist staff is kind and personable and I LOVE IT. Kuddos to the entire store and management for having a great team! This place lives up to the hype 100%  I arrived 15 mins before it opened and there was still a line. But the owner came out to greet people and gave out sausage samples.  Things I had a chance to try Turkey: not one part of that turkey was dry. I'm not a big fan of turkey but I would definitely order this again  Brisket: the fatty brisket was my favorite. Tender and moist, it just melts in your mouth. Pork Rib: they literally fell off the bone it was so tender.  As for sides I enjoyed the cheesy grits more than the beans. Both were good.  The pecan pie is worth grabbing. Good balance of sweetness and the crust is flakey, intact, and scrumptious.   Normally I don't care for service, but this place was amazing.  Would come back for sure. Not as good as the one on Las Vegas Boulevard and blue diamonds but it's never crowded and if you're in a hurry it's a great place to stop. It's also very nice inside with a lot of places to sit and they have outdoor seating It's been a while since I've been there, but the last time I was there, they renovated the hell out of the place.  They have a nice patio just south of the Second Cup on John St. with a nice view of the CN Tower.  The menu has a bit more than offer than most places and the quality is above average.  They also have a pretty decent beer selection which is decently priced.  If you are ever stuck for ideas as to where to eat around that part of town, give these guys a try. We love this store! They do a great job grooming our golden retriever, Ace. They have good quality food and our puppy loves their treats. We just came in for a grooming and they gave him some treats for free which made Ace's day! Thanks for taking care of our boy! This place is a hidden gem- really give it a try. I come here regularly and haven't had a less than stellar experience yet. The food is delicious. The service is so good, I've never met nicer management and servers. Bill has been running the place since April and he makes it feel so cozy, it's like a home away from home, with beer and burgers. I find there's a lot of business at Betty's nearby, but when you want a quieter night, bistro 243 is just down the street and is perfect. I am thoroughly pleased with Aargosy and with owner Roy.  I have a leather recliner that was not operating smoothly and had issues.  I initially started my search for help and look for help on Yelp with contacting another well-known company.  However, that didn't pan out.  Luckily, I had found Roy with extensive research and he responded immediately and professionally on the phone, which shortly carried out with an inservice home visit.  Roy is very convenient that his business is a mobile one and he was able to assess the issue quickly with just a minor fix and I was charged reasonably under $50 for this particular situation.  He specializes in fixing and the mechanics of recliners and has enlightened me with knowledge of the importance of choosing an American made recliner and keeping it maintained.  Roy is very pleasant, he was prompt during my service call all the way through the finished work and the recliner is like NEW and I am so grateful for his time and expertise.  He also fixed the issue at an unbeatable rate.  Thank you Roy and I wish you continuing success with your business. I have referred a few others who have also given positive feedback of their experiences too. Also thank you to fellow Yelper Shelley who created this business page that didn't exist previously for me to write a formal review and her heads up to me, to follow through with a well deserve review. :) Such a pleasant experience! The technician was gentle with me since pain is a major part of daily life for me. I really enjoyed the foot and lower leg massage; plus my toes look super cute!  My friend wanted penguins, so they brought over a tech that must specialize in freehand art, because her winter penguins are so adorable and fun!  The salon itself has a nice atmosphere. There is not a strong chemical smell, the selection of polishes is quite large, and it is beautifully decorated. The massage chairs look fairly new and are quite comfortable. They do take credit cards for payment, but be prepared to have cash for the tip. Looking for a quick mexican fix?  Good food, lots of seating and if you want to get in and out quickly this is the place.  Not the best mexican around but not the worst either. The coffee, here, is decent. Majority of the staff was kind and friendly but one employee ruined my whole experience. I came to sit and relax yet Kristen was rude and the most unpleasant person I have ever seen working. As I stood ordering my drink from the cashier, Kristen yelled at the other employees, said she wanted to scream, banged around machines and their products, and just insanely rude and loud. Maybe the place wasn't perfectly clean to her standards, but I just saw a conference of 8,000 people going on and the cafe was insanely busy throughout the day. Her absurd and temper tantrum like attitude is not was someone wants to hear while they are sitting at this cafe. Worst of all, I asked her nicely to make sure my drink was iced and not blended. Her response was, "obviously I'm making someone else's drink." I was shocked and upset and hope that she can figure out how to be nicer to her coworkers and customers. Awesome - super fun place to go. Very clean, and very new everything. Staff is usually pretty friendly and helpful. Menu always has good food. Very pricey - bring a group to split up your hourly cost! Very fun. Have been here a couple times now and have had mostly good experiences. I tried the kibbeh, tabouli, hummus, lamb kabob sandwich and shwarma. I've enjoyed everything, especially the hummus, except for the shwarma. Honestly, I've had better. But that's not enough to keep me from going back. The place always smells so awesome and there's still a million things on the menu I haven't tried yet! My experience today compelled me to write a review. I've been coming here very regularly and have raved to others about their long-lasting shellac.  Cindy is the best and one of her shellacs lasted almost a month! (With some tlc on my part).  They are pricey, which was previously my only issue. But worth it.  Sadly today I had my first negative experience and even more sadly it was with the owner Tina.  I requested a pedi and shellac and Tina worked on the pedi and mani, then handed off to Cindy for the shellac.  I was actually glad she did.  I know Tina is very busy which make me feel as if I wasn't being attended to and rushed- very rough pedi.  The salon had a bad bottle of Polish - color too thin - which I has picked out obviously unknowingly. I guess Tina thought it was mine because she spoke in a brusque tone about it and made me pick something else .  Only afterwards did she learn that it was their polish, not mine.  Perhaps Tina needs more staff so that she can focus on managing rather than doing nails because she seems way too busy to do a top notch job, which is what I've had from the other technicians up to now.  You guys are too pricey for anything else less than the best service.  Based on today I could have gone somewhere else and paid half the price for this level of service. I know you can do better Tina's nails. If you are looking for great authentic Italian food. This is the place Every meal has been fantastic. Reasonable priced Great service Very clean. Honest review: Made an appointment at 12:30 was waiting for an hour and nothing, 2 people came in after me and was seen, bot to mention after every haircut they each took a 10 min smoke break, as i was walking out (without a haircut) they yelled, next time make an appointment bro.....   Dont go here unless you're a regular customer First time here and there seemed to be a bit of a missing selection but nonetheless i came out with some linzer tortes, a creamed horn, and a long john doughnut. Linzer tortes and creamed horn were good but nothing amazing. BUT THAT DOUGHNUT. I savored every bite. I licked the box, dreamt about it, and wish every single day that i had a prantl's doughnut. The cream on top is what dreams are made of. Other than that, the individual cakes looked good but were around $5 each and that didn't make sense for something i could make at home. Goods a bit overpriced but those doughnuts were worth every penny! My experience seems to have differed from that of many people here.  Our waiter, Elias, was extremely efficient and friendly (ok, he did get a little snappy when he realized we'd finished eating a while earlier and hadn't called for him for the next course, but we were dining, not just experiencing the dark, and enjoying each other's company), never mixed up orders, projected his voice expertly so we always knew when he was coming to us and not to the next group at the long table (a gap of one seat on either side was left between us and their party).  My fish and veggies was quite good. I like breading and crunch on my fish, so that suited me quite well. The rice was lovely, though there wasn't much. The veg was slightly over-steamed green beans (my guest got steamed asparagus with his steak). I'd called that "fish and veggie," no "s", but that's just a quibble.   As previous reviewers have mentioned, you're hunting your food around the plate and more than once (especially with something like green beans, that can be hard to keep on a fork when you CAN see what you're doing!) you'll get a fork to your mouth only to discover there's nothing on it.  The desserts were sorbet and chocolate mousse. The mousse was delectable, though it had some sort of soft brownie or cake beneath; I literally couldn't get just one mouthful cut off and found myself with a HUGE chunk that needed to be nibbled off in the dark. I felt like a little kid, because without my napkin to scrub my face, I'd have left the room with chocolate *everywhere* on my face.   I know some people find the "atmosphere" straining or uncomfortable in the dark. I was actually with a friend who is usually quite quiet, but was much *more* animated in the dark and we had a wonderful chat while we enjoyed our food.  The room is *dark*. They have double-layer black-out curtains to keep all light from the door or kitchen window out of the room; I'm *extremely* photosensitive so could just make out a bit of movement when my friend waved his hands at me, but that was it.   The one warning I'd give, other than the ones given by others here (and I definitely disagree with some of them - we enjoyed our food and the service, though it wasn't the best meal either of us had ever had), is:   If you are photosensitive, BE CAREFUL.  The moment I walked out of the dining room, I had *stabbing* pains in my eyes. So bad strangers were offering me sunglasses, and one of the sighted servers saw me in obvious pain and brought me to a very dark corner to give my eyes more time (she mentioned that they do, occasionally, get a customer like me, whose eyes don't adjust back quickly, and recommended I keep sunglasses on until I went to bed). I was in pain the rest of the night. :( Awesome daycare for my little Lily! The staff is great, everyone is always super nice and helpful. The facility is always clean and well maintained. The outdoor and indoor play areas are spacious and clean. My puppy looks forward to going and she's always excited to see the staff. The hours are great as well, I'm a nurse and work 12hr shifts and the daycare is very accommodating. If you're looking for an affordable great doggie daycare, this is the place. If I could give this place a zero, I would. We had top shelf margaritas. Basically good tequila with very bad store mix and a little guest fruit fly. Atmosphere and service was about the same. New is always better right? It is especially true in this situation. Think of this place as the smaller, newer version of XS back during its glory days.  I remember when XS used to be the IT club and now it's Drai's. On the rooftop? With an outdoor and indoor area? and a wading area? I'm so there! They allow you to take off your shoes and dance in the pool if you like too.   When we were there, the staff made it rain and I don't mean with water. They literally threw out one dollar bills on the dance floor. They did it a few times. We ended up with $17 at the end of the night. With free admission for ladies, we came up!  Even though the place is smaller than other clubs you go to, this place bundles everything up in a nice package. You will find all the good looking, young people here too!  This is definitely Vegas' next hotspot. Marquee, watch out! We had a double queen bed and it looked pretty nice. The room has a living room area that's a level lower than the bedroom level. However, we found that the room had many issues. Many outlets didn't work, the bathroom door didn't lock, etc. but they have everything you need and maybe some extra. I really loved their bathroom. Very well decorated and furnished,me specially the dressing make up area.  The pool on the fourth floor was a little disappointing. It didn't seem very well maintained or organized. Maybe if we went in summer time, it'll be different. Price points are awesome 2 different happy hours. Great menu of food and drinks. They do brunch and also live music and DJ,so. This new place will soon be popular. I'm not really sure if I like this place.  They're set up to where there are a couple small rooms and each room has a couple tables in it.  It might get a little crowded if you go with a decent sized party (10ish).  The things that stood out on the menu were some Filipino dishes that you're not used to seeing at any restaurant that serves sushi.  According to the waiter, the head chef is a Filipino guy.  The waiter did a very good job selling the stuff to us, but as a Filipino, I certainly knew better than to pay $18 for six pieces of lumpia, or $20 for some pancit.  I'm sure the chef cooks them well, but those two dishes should never cost that much unless you have enough to feed an army.  Most of what we ordered was less than memorable and what really stood out were the steaks.  The filet came out rare and the ribeye came medium rare.  Both were amazing!  I'd go back and order just those.  A couple hundred dollars spent for 6 of us was ok.  A little overpriced for what they sold but hey, that's Vegas. This is one of my favorite places to eat. The food is great and the prices are decent. The only thing i really hate is the long wait times. The hostess always say 20-25 minutes and like last week we were there for 1 hour and 15 minutes until we said enough is enough seat us now. Even when you do call ahead seating you still wait 30-45 minutes. I love the place so I suffer. Food came out at room temperature. We were the first there on a Saturday and expected fairly fast service. The flavor in the Tacos was good but nothing on the plate was hot. The food temp seemed like it was sitting for awhile. I'm not sure what is going on with Hot Taco in regards to food not coming out hot. The service was great and our waitress was excellent, but the food not being HOT really disappointed us.   The manager came out and apologized. He also took care of the bill. I want to give them a second chance but it seems others have been since our visit so I'm apprehensive. I think this place would be great for drinking but not eating. Kinda sad since there are so many great options for dinning in this area and I hoped finally we would get a great place for Tacos. I guess we will wait and see if the reviews become positive before visitng again. Only reason I stopped in was because I wanted the Lorac mega pro palette 2 and Sephora doesn't carry Lorac anymore.   I purchased the palette and when I got home the entire thing was covered in gold shadow, one of the shadows was broken and spilled everywhere.  I had to go back the next day and when I mentioned the need for the exchange I didn't even get an apology, she just said "make sure you check this one" which I had already done.  I also noticed that the Lorac section had a sign that stated a gift with purchase, when I mentioned it to her she said "we ran out of the gifts" not even giving me eye contact. I then told her, well then I suggest you take down the sign...to which she didn't reply.  It upsets me because this is a 60.00 eyeshadow palette (that's not cheap) and they act like they're doing you a favor. I know retail during the holidays is tough but they are like this year round. The customer service at this location is horrible, I'd rather go to Sephora or order online. I'm not dealing with their attitude anymore. This by far is probably one of the other places I have worked out at and sweat is dripping all over me. Forget fancy gyms and studio, if you want down and dirty, this is for you. The workouts are never the same, the owners Dallas and Braden will push you beyond belief and the music is kick ass. I also like fact that you can go at your own pace. When I feel myself comparing my pace to the others, the owners remind me that my only competition is myself and to do better than before. Try a class or personal session,trust me you won't be sorry! Fast and great service, excellent customer service. Came here for a quick carwash on a Wednesday afternoon. no wait. I had an hour wait for my flight so the attendant suggested Winners. I would not call it a winner. I had to wait over 45 minutes between ordering my food and having it delivered to me at my table in a to-go box!!! The food was good but the wait is way too long and it is unclear why the wait is so long unless all of the Winners in the airport share the same kitchen. I was not able to finish my food before my flight so I ended up being the weirdo on the plane the to-go box that everyone is staring at (lol). No more Winners for me unless I have a LONG layover. Paragon Glass arranged for me to get my glass fixed and tinted while I was in Phoenix for vacation.  A couple of months later something in the back window area is leaking and she started working hard to get it fixed and cleaned up even without known 100% if it is the back window leaking.  Excellent, fast, knowledgeable customer service! The quality of the food here teeters on the line between low end dine-in and just quick fast food- the "I'm so hungry, I'll eat anything and it'll taste good anyway" kind.  The fish tacos are good. The fish is well seasoned and fresh. The cabbage gives the tacos good flavor. Anything that makes this place stand out? No not really. But if you're hunger and looking for a place to sit down, this place will fill your tummy. I wouldn't have eaten here if it wasn't down the street from my friend's house. I was truly disappointed with Pint Central. The name inaccurately describes the selection they have of draft beers. When I visited, there were few beers available, several were tapped out. The atmosphere was not at all what I expected. For being a beer place, i expected garagey/sporty or just very relaxed atmosphere. If was more of an awkward club like feeling with blue lights. Staff were not the most friendly. I don't intend on returning. I'll make the haul to Duckworth's instead. Aggressive driving and going thru red lights on Forbes Ave May not be ideal for a towing company - ambulance perhaps but not towing. Please drive better. This is my favorite restaurant in Tempe. We have been eating their since they were at the corner of University and Mill Ave. We were so happy when they reopened at the corners of Southern & McClintock. We used to walk to the old location, but now we have to drive a few miles, but it is well worth the drive. The family that runs it is awesome and we have become quite friendly with them. Had heard some good things about Marigold Maison and decided to check it out on a Sunday evening.   We had a reservation at 6 and were able to get seated right as the place was about to get slammed. First thing you walk in, there is no host station and you have to just hope one of the staff members will approach you to get your table. Once we sat down it was roughly a 10-15 minute wait until we were greeted. They gave us our menus and then after about another 10 minutes they dropped off 2 waters for 3 people. Eventually everyone was able to get their own beverage and we ordered appetizers.   We started off with the Garlic Naan and Chicken Dip. The Garlic Nan was light and airy with a crisp finish. Really enjoyed it with the Chicken Dip. The dip itself was flavorful and the chicken was prepared nicely. It was a really good start to the meal from a food perspective.  For our entrees we had the Saag Spinach with shrimp, Chicken Curry and Chicken Tikka. The Saag Spinach had a nice spice to it and a velvety texture. It combined savory flavor with the spice and went well with the rice they provided. The shrimp were cooked perfectly, big and juicy. The naan also went well with this dish as the saag has a stew-like consistency.   Chicken Curry is one of the first dishes I picture when thinking about Indian food and we were not disappointed. This was also a very spicy dish as we requested but the spice did not overwhelm the other flavors. The chicken fit in perfectly and was also accompanied by rice. The dish as a whole was very impressive and the spice blend was second to none.   The Chicken Tikka is essentially a whole roasted chicken with dark and white meat. We got a side of hot sauce for the chicken which was laid upon a bed of sautéed vegetables. The hot sauce lived up to its name and was a great compliment to the chicken which was dusted in an array of spices. The chicken was juicy on the inside and had crispy skin. It is also a good sized portion.   The food was really good and it was ashame that the service was so bad. Drink refills were not done without multiple requests, and while they were busy, its not an excuse to just ignore your tables. But it wasn't reserved just for us, the table directly next to us did not see a server for at least 20 minutes and had to actually grab their own menus.   With the food being so good I was willing to overlook the bad service but things got even worse. Upon paying the bill, the server hovered over us as we attempted to sign the check. Right as we set the pen down after signing the check, we were told to leave. The quote I believe was "we are really busy and need you to leave right now." It took me a moment to process that we were being kicked out of the restaurant due to their inability to handle good business. I grew up in the restaurant business and have held a variety of roles and had never seen nor heard of guests being told to leave the moment they sign the bill in order to get another table sat. At most we just wanted to take a moment to relax and finish our beverages but we obliged as I knew if I stayed any longer I would have had to say something about being treated like that.   I can forgive inattentiveness when a restaurant is busy, but blatant disrespect is another thing. Its a shame as the entire party enjoyed the food but we all agreed that that was our first and last visit to the Marigold Maison if you are kicked out of the restaurant the moment you pay your bill.   The two stars is out of respect to the efforts of the kitchen staff which were impressive. After seeing the photos of the bacon tempura, we had to give this place a try! We ordered that, the yellowtail poke tacos, grilled salmon ochazuke, short rib bowl, and Mexican sushi roll. Everything was good, but the bacon tempura and salmon ochazuke were definitely my faves!  The service was great and the restaurant was modern, clean and they played awesome late 80's/early 90's music, which we loved!  I wish I could give them 4 1/2 stars. I just rarely give 5 stars. But I'd definitely go back! Great service combined with great Italian food warrants my high rating. Multiple servers checked on us to make sure our needs and expectations were being met. Meals at our table included the Gnocchi, Veal Marsala and Gorgonzola Penne pasta. This was my second visit here and felt the experience worthy of a review. We arrived during the mid-day Beat the Clock Happy Hour. Our waitress took about 10 minutes to take our order. I ordered a margarita. She forgot to ask salt or no, so I sent it back and asked if I could have one no salt; she just wiped the salt off of it. We had ordered 2 appetizers, but they came 20 minutes in between. We asked for the manager & the waitress became nicer. I felt like the length of service was designed to avoid "Beating the Clock". Customer service needs a LOT of improvement. None of my 3 visits has gone right. Stingy portion of meat, order mixed up w/ another customer, and spoiled guac. Not returning anymore. This was the worst pizza I have ever had. The cheese and sauce had both a sour taste and smell. The crust was bland and hard. The price was right at $3.99 so I gave it a try instead of going to a pizza franchise...but it was too horrible to eat. We stopped into The Social Page to look for some cool wedding items and ideas, although we didn't buy anything we did leave a little more inspired with some fresh ideas based on some stuff we saw. The Social Page started as an extensive and unique stationary store; they do appointments and consultations to bring your ideas from concept to completion. These days it's also a great local store that carries fashion accessories (mostly female), jewelry, toys, giftware, home décor, novelty items and other seasonal items. Despite specializing more in the stationary area they have some pretty cool gift/décor items which was why I wanted to visit.  The 3 biggest reasons I'd suggest checking out The Social Page is 1) They have unique stuff you wouldn't find elsewhere 2) They're diverse, they have a lot of little knick-knacks in a lot of sub-categories of giftware and décor, and 3) They're local! I'm a bit disappointed they don't showcase much of their wedding accessories/décor in-store as this was the primary reason for our visit. If you're looking for their wedding stuff as well you'll likely be re-directed to their online store. They have a lot of great items for weddings online, but what's unfortunate for me is it's really just a partner/affiliate with the parent company "weddingstar" when you shop online. weddingstar is a solid supplier, but it takes away from the local aspect a bit and it doesn't offer me much incentive to purchase indirectly from The Social Page subdivision of weddingstar since I could actually get better deals directly from weddingstar through their promotions :(.  On my most recent visit I also wasn't offered any assistance which I found surprising as they usually pride themselves on customer service. I've been here before and had good service. Cool store, constantly getting new and unique items, worth checking out the odd the odd time. I love this place and eat here at least twice per month.  I have had most of the items on the menu.  Main dishes I can recommend:  pork chops, porterhouse steak, chicken critters, sirloin steak, pulled pork dinner.  The green beans are the best in town.  Also love the loaded sweet potato. The homemade yeast rolls are something you will crave.  The chili and macaroni and cheese are subpar and I would not recommend either of these items.   If you order a margarita make sure you add a "kicker."  The 1800 is the best.  It can be loud at times especially when they turn up their music and do their western dance routine.  Very reasonably priced for high quality food. I think the Gold Spike is uber swank, I like it here. It reminds me of the Bay Area. Had a private tour of the room renovations and an explanation of the "vision" for downtown. Wait and see I say, Vegas is reinventing herself every chance she gets. The crowd here is business/professional/casual/hip at least it has been every time I have been in. Again, reminds me of the Bay. Awesome possum. These patties are great, meat tasted really fresh. The employee I met was really pleasant, overall great experience. Def recommend to anyone who likes patties and co co bread. Cute decors... That's all Drinks and food were over priced for the quality and portion. Had my Birthday dinner here while staying at the Marriott and the service and food were exceptional. you have to get the lobster potstickers and sushi for appetizers and the butterfish and short ribs for main dish! so yum!! Ashley Scott opened this cute little salon along with 2 other stylists... they've been at this location for 6 months or so, and it's so convenient!    Ashley has been doing my highlights and haircuts pretty much since I moved here almost 3 years ago.  I love it because I have no worries when I go to Ashley.  She always gives me a great cut and natural looking highlights.  She's got a great energy about her and the salon itself is colorful, hip, and welcoming!  If you have to wait at all, they have plenty of magazines and a massage chair!  Actually, I've never had to wait more than a few minutes as Ashley keeps her own schedule and is always on time... but I've enjoyed the massage chair when waiting for color to set.  If you're looking for a great stylist who will give you personal attention in a casual, fun environment (not a chop shop at all)... give Ashley a call! They have an extensive Vegetarian/Vegan/Gluten Free/Paleo menu and their online tool really allows you to see how their food is prepared and acts as a good guide to determine what fits your needs. The Late Night HH tapas menu is super cheap and a great treat at the end of the day. Highly recommend the hummus trio, black bean burger, and philly chicken pita for those who aren't as GF/Vegan sensitive. Came here with a group of friends last time. It is usually good so I'm not sure what happened. We came on a weekend during yum cha hours where they push carts and should have everything ready. Their siu mai is pork and shrimp and it was raw. We sent it back and they gave us another one... which was also raw. We went it back AGAIN, and it came back AGAIN RAW. You can't serve raw pork to ur customers. Luckily my friend checked it because I'm sure most people don't and just eat it and get food poisoning later. The jelly fish we ordered , they Gave us the end of jelly fish which was hard and not edible. We complained and asked them for a new dish but they refused to give us a new jelly fish order. I would give it 2 stars because all my other experiences were great except this one but honestly, giving it one star only because the siu mai came back raw 3 times and that's just unacceptable. Wow! The pizza was amazing and hand made. Probably one of the few times I actually saw the dough being made and prepared fresh. The cheese was melty and Perfect.  Service was top notch too, the man behind the counter was friendly and I could tell he really enjoyed making pizzas. He was more excited about it than I was. Great place. This place has amazing food and service.  First time coming here and it was fantastic Update: got the interior trim piece and the floor mats from Scott as he promised a few weeks back. Very satisfied with the service from Hertz Car Sales and now looking into booking a vacation to use the free week in a rental from Hertz. Loved this show. Laughed and smiled the entire time. Took our 9 year old twins and they thought it was awesome. They are still talking about the show. Amazing show! Chicken gyro was pretty good but the garlic sauce atop made the amazing! Side Greek salad had the freshest and most abundant feta cheese I've ever tasted -- delicious quick lunch stop! Had a great burger with a nice open atmosphere at the new hello bistro in mccandless crossing.  What a great space with tasty comfort food.  I am not a big drinker so this place gets the job done for the kids and I.  Look forward to trying more of their menu. Eat n park co. Has hit a homerun on this concept.  I can't speak for the rest of the locations in the Pittsburgh area but this one, at least for the moment, has got a good thing going. I'm such a fan!  Our Nishikawa Black Ramen bowl was everything I hope it would be in this chilly, rainy winter evening after a day spent hiking in the rain.  It was rich and deep, full of interesting flavors and textures and all the umami I dreamed of.    The spring rolls and gyoza were also yummy but the star of the show was definitely ramen.  It was soooo busy tonight, we were seated fairly quickly and our food came out fast.  Our waitress forgot our drink orders and didn't really check on us but I'm sure she saw we were busy slurping our noodles.  The restaurant is clean and small.  The prices are good!  If you're looking for a good ramen spot, go!  I'll be back soon.  It was incredible! Located in the sprawling suburb of Brampton this community centre is a great place for anyone that is interested in being active from young and old alike. There is a massive swimming pool, with a very large slide, kids pool and lanes dedicated for proper cardio swim.  There is also a hockey rink, a figure skating rink, basketball courts and a very large gym with a track.  The gym does get busy after work hours but its a good crowd.  The only thing missing in my opinion is an indoor soccer field, however a short jaunt down sandlewood and you will find a huge indoor soccer complex on the corner of Dixie rd. Enjoy. More coupon issues, this time with target coupons out of their little 4th of july promo book. The computer won't over read their own coupons and the cashier was rude and incompetent I left with out the item and went down the street and bought it elsewhere.  I don't know why I bother to continue to try this store, and other target is better then this and they just don't seem to care. Go to North Olmsted or W117th instead. Whatever you do, stay away from any free deal these people offer for you to sit through their timeshare presentation!!! On the paperwork it says the presentation lasts for 2-2 and a half hrs. Well when we showed up, our salesman told us we would be with him for the next 3 hrs. He was so nice at first, got along with my friend and I, laughed a lot and then when we asked how much the timeshare was, he wouldn't answer and kept changing the subject. He took us outside to show us the "beautiful view" which was dead desert. Not too beautiful to me. He walked us to the common room where people hangout and watch tv, everyone had to be 75 yrs and older, I am 30. It seemed more like a retirement home than a timeshare. I noticed it had been over two hrs and thanked him for his time but we weren't interested. He said we were not allowed to leave until the 3 hrs was up. I told him I signed a paper which said I only had to stay for two to two and a half hrs. He said if we left we would not receive the free things we were promised. So at this point we have literally been blackmailed and kidnapped since what I signed said I could leave after two hrs.  I figured we could tough it out since it would only be another 45 minutes. That 45 minutes felt longer than the first 2 hrs. These guys don't know the word no, they do not listen to you and they turn into assholes after they know you won't buy from them. I said no about 30 times and the manager walks up, tells us a guy is selling his timeshare and I can get it for the price of $12,000. Half price of what the timeshare was (which was a complete lie) I said no. He then lowered it to $4,000. Again, I said no. He then offered me the timeshare for free and all I had to do was pay the $1,000 taxes each year and put down $1400 today and my week stays would be the $209 a week. I swear if I had to hear them say " and for ONLY $209 a week you can stay ANYWHERE in the world" one more time, I was going to scream. They made my friend cry out of frustration of not allowing us to leave  at the 3 hr mark and they kept pressuring us and wouldn't sign the paper saying we finished the presentation. It was like they wanted to make us so mad I would just sign up so they would shut up. When you don't listen to a girl when she says no, hold her against her will and make her cry and say sexual remarks about her body the entire time it's a close feeling to being sexually abused.....not okay.....At 3 hrs and 20 minutes we were finally told we could leave.....finally free. We were sent to another room to tell a man how our presentation went. As my friend was still crying we told him how awful it was. He had to fill out a questionnaire on our answers and the question on the page said "how was the presentation" after we told him how awful they were to us I saw him write "good" on the answer line.....he straight up lied on their questionnaire! I then was sent to another man to get my 4 free nights at the Luxor and my $200 deposit back. He said it would take two days to be put back into my account. It took over a week. When we got on the bus, everyone had similar stories. I was the only one who was dumb enough to put a $200 deposit down. So if you do want to visit Hell on earth for free stuff, you do NOT have to put the deposit down! Don't do it. We all agreed it was not worth the free stuff they promise. If you love PF changs, or Americanized chinese food then this is the place for you.  Flavors were okay nothing amazing.  Not sure how we ended up here but left this place still asking for more.  Food was mediocre, not for me though   Im asian, I should've known better :P Clean, friendly, fast and good quality dry-cleaning will make me a happy person. Plus, their prices are totally reasonable! Their coffee machine has a joke written on the side of it. I love a solid sense of humor.  I will drive the extra few miles from downtown to Lakewood just for this place. Jason and Jed are extremely professional and always provide great customer service.. I would recommend Atlas to everyone!! Another great recommendation by my foodie colleague. Small sushi place in downtown. Went on the weekend and got a table for 5 after a 20 or so minute wait. Friendly staff. Great purple rice sushi and very fresh sashimi. Got their OMG roll as well and it was definitely worth a try. Overall a very good experience. The blizzard of the month, Chocolate Candy Shop, is awesome! Great first impression with interior design and cleanliness. Bright welcoming environment with very comfortable chairs. Took advantage of the buy one get one free drink promo. Had the mango green tea with coconut jelly adjusted to low sugar and low ice. It was excellent, refreshing and hit the spot. Would definitely recommend. Very cute and quaint place. Well decorated. They really give good value for the cost. We ordered spicy eggplant and pad sew ew. They gave so much beef! Yum. Great service too! This place is excellent. Lots of personality, the food is excellent. I went with a couple friends, the guy at the front asks everyone's name and if your new they will give you s complimentary order of garlic knots. I had the Sicilian  slice with extra cheese and a chicken parmigiano hero and one of my guests had a calzone  the other an eggplant parmigiano hero. All food was excellent and we will be going back. I would have given it 5 stars but it took s little long to get our food, but it was Saturday night and it was busy. Next time I go I will do an update on speed of service, I'm sure the food will still be great. Overall this is a great sushi joint. Fresh, clean, and service is awesome. The prices are a little high but it's worth it. Didn't have very high expectations based on the reviews and then was pleasantly surprised by the meat buns! Pretty juicy! Xiaolongbao is also soupy with nice, thin crust. Also loved the dry pot with mixed mushrooms. I think you can't go wrong ordering what they're known for. Don't go for the canto/taiwanese stuff. My nephews and niece wanted Mexican for dinner and they mentioned this place.  I was not impressed.  1st the ordering system is really out of the ordinary and complicated when trying to order for 6 people.  They have 3 different lines for specific types of tacos so if you are wanting to try different types you will have to stand in all three lines.  The thing that really upset me was the terrible service.  I mentioned to the lady who was walking around that it was my first time visiting and she shrugged her shoulders and didn't offer me any direction on how to order.  I finally figured it out after watching other people order so I got in line.  2nd the guy making the tacos was super rude and almost annoyed at the fact that I was ordering different types of tacos.  3rd when I finally made it to the register to pay I had to wait until the girl at the register was done talking to another employee about how she couldn't wait to get out of work.  I'm standing there holding a tray with 25 tacos and she doesn't even bother to say one moment please they just ignore me as if I'm not even there.  4th the food was cold because the meats are sitting in a bin and all they do is chop it up when you order it, they don't even reheat it. I'm assuming the holding bin is suppose to keep the meats hot but it wasn't.  Qualify of meat gets a C.  Flavor gets a D.  Service gets an F.  I will not be back. Came here on a Friday night right around 6:30pm as happy hour was ending, it wasn't too busy.  Service: Server was busy too know what was going on. We asked if we can get a spicier salsa...He forgot about our request and when the salsa came out, all we tasted was Tabasco sauce. We also had to remind him about getting our 2nd round of drinks.  Food: I'll be real, I am no mexican food snob but this was the run of the mill Mexican restaurant. Nothing special or over the top good. We ordered the Ceviche = way too salty, the Enchiladas Veracruz = really bland, Taco Pollo = still bland, The Fajitas with the steak+chicken+ribs = really avg.  Atmosphere: it's decent for wanting to be a "gourmet" restaurant. The place is clean and the staff for the most part was nice.  I've been here a few times, but there is no particular reason for me to come back. A fun atmosphere and cheerful, attentive service, but holy cow, the SALT!!!!!  I ordered the eggplant parmigiana and it was so insanely loaded with salt, it was quite literally inedible.  The server was good about removing it from the bill, and I hope the kitchen was advised of the issue. Seriously, it was as if the salt shaker had dropped into the pot of sauce, and they just shrugged and served it anyway. My companion tasted it, and agreed...so it wasn't just me! It's getting three stars because of the PRICES!  A water doesn't need to be 6.50! This company needs to be embarrassed. Water comes from the earth, not from a huge company making processed beverages, so prices for alcoholic drinks need to be 6.50 not A WATER! Calm down on prices!! It's getting really pathetic.  My hot dog was 9.00, and it comes with chips (and you get no choice of chips) and some chili sauce. Was the food good? Yeah but not worth these prices. A meal like this should have only cost 9.00 dollars, water included.   This small meal was 16.00! They are taking advance of people and their money. I tried this place once for their poke bowl and another for their coffee.   Maybe I haven't tried any other place yet for poke bowls, but I thought it was pretty good. There were a large number of ingredients to choose from, the quality was decent and the service was satisfactory. The price is a little above average for a poke bowl however.  In regards to their coffee, it was not sour and was robust in terms of flavour profile. Been going here the last couple Sundays to watch Niner games with the Niner Nation, who reserves a room with a large screen TV. I've been a little late as I watch the morning games until conclusion to check my fantasy points, so the room has been packed and I get stuck at the bar. They are a friendly group of people so that's cool.  This review is for the bar itself, and the specials. $3 bloody mary's, coors light, and some other beer I will never drink. Food specials are only $4.99 cheeseburgers w/fries, chili cheese dog, or some fancy fries. I usually get the cheeseburger and its been OK. The bloody marys are pretty weak and pretty tame. Service is extremely busy, and so its hit or miss after you initially sit down and order.   Overall, its a nice bar with a raised table seating area, a large bar with gaming, and a couple of rooms for groups. TV's everywhere so you won't miss any of the action. I'll be back for sure to root for my Niners, and as they lose proceed to enjoy alcoholic beverages. This is hands down one of the best Jamaican restaurants in the gta! I was greeted by a pleasant female server with a smile. No long wait time, free WiFi,  tasteful and edible food well pleasing to the eye and stomach.  Can't wait to go back again Based on the nam eighties place I would expect Otto be bar style food. However, their menu is a little fancy compared to what I had expected. Their salads are very good and the service has always been great. There's not a lot of parking close to it but at least it's located in a shopping center. Wait times are sometimes very long and there aren't many seats for people who are waiting. There is also a massive bird problem if you happen to sit outside. Sometimes their specials are to die for and I really wish the buffalo chicken dip was an actual menu item. I did get food poisoning once from the buffalo chicken so I no longer order chicken from them.
