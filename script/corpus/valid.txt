Not bad at all.  The standard dishes - chinese broccoli, xiu mai, ha cao, chicken feet, black bean pork ribs, steamed bbq pork bun, shrimp wrapped in thick rice noodle, chinese donut wrapped in rice noodle - were all a-ok.  The rice and chicken served in a vertical bamboo cup was tasty; flavors were similar to Vietnamese 'com ga', with ginger, light soy, and chicken.  The xiu mai had orange/yellow 'eggs' on it which tasted like crab innards/tomal/mustard; rich and super flavorful.  All the dumplings were packed with meat and/or seafood and not a lot of fillers (yay!).  The only downside is that the offerings are limited/uninspired; just the basics.  I'd come back if I were in LV and craving dim sum.  Other important info: small establishment, push cart servers, prices are higher than CA but definitely reasonable, located inside Gold Coast Hotel off the Strip next to RIo and across from the Palms. I ordered the Heart Shaped pizza and meatball sliders on V-day and it really hit the spot. My honey and I both had to work but wanted something easy that maintains the V-day spirit. Why not a heart shaped pizza? They had a special of a large heart shape with an extra topping for about $20 with tax. Pretty good deal! If you don't already know, Metro pizza serves up a pretty yum pie. I am familiar with a few of their locations, and this one did not taint the reputation.  My favorite thing from Metro however, is not the pizza. It is their meatball sliders with fries. BOMB! Yummy meatball sheltered in a garlic knot, YAS PLEASE! They are soooo good! The fries is really good too. Only complaint, fries portion shrinks every time we order the sliders. Please don't skimp on the fries! My experience with Metro is solely based on take out. I need to plan a time to dine-in. I knew coming here, there would be a long line. We waited about 25 mins which isn't too bad. There is a menu displayed around the corner so it is nice to look at what you want to order before you get to the cashier.  We got the infamous "slut," Fairfax sandwich and some orange juice. The orange juice taste so good! So refreshing and taste fresh squeeze! The Slut is pretty good, its eggs and mash potatoes with bread to dip. The sandwiches are amazing and the Fairfax doesn't disappoint. I still think of the bread and how soft it is!   Just give it a try, you won't be disappointed. Wow...no reviews on here yet? I am surprised...I love this gym.  I like a lot of gyms, but I LOVE this gym!  I started training with Bobby at Results Only right before my wedding and within 10 weeks of working out with Bobby I lost about 15 lbs and 1 dress size. My husband had similiar results. My arms never looked better...I was sincerely a beautiful bride...at age 43 I looked better at this wedding than my 1st one!   When we first started looking at gyms we were struggling with how to fit in everything we were looking for in a gym...times of classes, co-ed so we both could attend, small enough for personalized attention, motivating enough to keep us coming back and fun...we hate working out, so if we were going to avoid going out for drinks and dinner we needed some SERIOUS motivation.  The group training is co-ed, the classes are offered at the perfect times for our schedule, the gym is near our home and the owner, Bobby, is crazy funny and terribly motivating - he keeps us going!  BUT....I really knew that Results Only fit our family and our lifestyle when Bobby introduced his TEEN fitness program to my son! Bobby was an instant hit with my Pre-Teen and now he is eagerly getting in shape and learning about fitness, gaining confidence and having fun at Results Only. We are hooked. I can't imagine where we would find a gym like this and I have tried quite a few gyms in the valley - and have great things to say about many of them - but Bobby has offered us the MOST for our family and delivered the highest level of results.   Thanks Bobby...from all of us! I can't wait to see what we look like on our wedding anniversary! They have good chicken and bomb biscuits when fresh. I just hate the service and paying for sauce. I mean I just bought a 12 pc bucket can I have atleast one sauce? I understand if I didn't buy chicken but whatever lol end rant. Just pulled up about 20 minutes ago and no one was at the drive-thru, pulled up again because they appeared after we were gone. Took them about 5 minutes to take our order. In addition, she was giving attitude because we said hello due to bad audio coming through. I only gave 1 star because we actually got our food. Very irritated and disappointed. Been a while since we came here but loved it.  Little bit loud but ok and maybe not as fancy as some of its other locations (Chicago, Miami), but:  - food was same and awesome.   - loved the Wygu Beef Gyoza, couple rolls we had, salad, drinks, etc.  Great menu right now they have to choose from.  Seems the same in all cities for the moment. Food was good but  took forever. It seemed like they needed more help. 20 minutes for not being that busy.  Hopefully next visit is better. Excellent coffee cake, like to die for!! Tortilla soup was a major hit! Great experience for first day in Vegas! Read the reviews and thought I would try it. Yelpers were on point with this one. Good Asian fare, reasonably priced and nice portions. Food was very fresh tasting and seasoning not overpowering. I will definitely come back. Service was great also. This is a hidden gem in the Hard Rock! This is my favorite park in Vegas!   2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     12/100   I've heard about this park from family and friends over the years, but didn't experience it myself till sometime last year. After that, I began coming here for my morning cardio (walk/run/hike) several days a week.   I agree with many of the reviews for this park. It has a little bit of everything and more.   - A bad ass playground I wish existed during my childhood.   - A huge grassy area for picnics, soccer, and just laying out to relax, read a good book, write or draw. I've seen some photographers do their photo sessions here.   - There is a path way to a small mountain, great for a short hike.      It's a great hike if you want to do a solo hike in the morning. Every morning that I've been here there were others hiking the trail, doing their morning cardio/workouts as well. So I felt safe knowing that there were others around if I accidentally fell or what not.   - There is no cement trail up and down the mountain.  It's just dirt and gravel. So be careful.  - There are different pathways up and down the hill for the adventurous souls. (Not recommended for beginners. Check out the trail first before you go exploring :-) )   - There are two levels up the mountain. So you can rest at the 1st level. It has a shaded picnic table and a great view of the city.   - At the top, there's a huge platform with an amazing view of the city. With a little bit of Nevada history. It's peaceful at the top. And reminds me why I love nature and this city.   - Some people do their Tai Chi and/or meditation in the morning. Either at the top of the mountain or in the park.  It's peaceful to watch.   - There's a small cement stage at the other end of the park. I'm guessing for plays and performances during the warmer months.   - Bathrooms are clean and stocked every morning.   - Great park to bring your doggies and fur buddies as well.   *** Tip: If you don't live in Mountain's Edge & you're coming from I-15/Blue Diamond or 215/Buffalo, it's on Buffalo road & you'll have to make a U-turn to get to the entrance of this park. If you are looking for Chinese acrobats as in other Cirque du Solei shows, don't go to this show.  But if you love the Fab 4 and a great visual show interpreting a variety of their songs- you have to see this show.    Although our seats were good there didn't seem to be a bad seat in the house.   The costumes were amazing - a visual masterpiece and the sound was INSANE (just like the ticket prices!)   I especially love how they took sound bites of the Beatles talking and incorporated it into the show.  Oh how I wish I could have been brought up when music was really meaningful...(sigh). We have been trying Eggplant sandwiches all over the valley because my day loves eggplant.  Delfaco's sandwich on the Italian Hoagie had way way too much bread more bread than eggplant.  The eggplant by itself was very tasty, but get it without so much bread, you will thank me later.  We will be back to try something else.  I went at 11 am on a Saturday morning and still waited over 30 minutes for a take out order.  It is a very crammed space, a little Italian deli in between a Italian grocery store.  The prices for the Italian pastas and cheese are a bit over priced.  The espresso is nicely priced at $1.40 for a single shot. I read some good reviews on this place and decided to give it a try . I was not disappointed ! My son and I really liked the Chicken Fried Steak . You could tell it was handmade with cube steak and not a frozen patty . The cinnamon roll was also homemade with good icing , not too sweat like cinnabon . They also have preserves that are made by the owner , and the raspberry is out of this world . I bought a small mason jar to take home . The biscuits were fluffy , grits cooked just right , and eggs cooked perfectly could have used another one . We will be coming back and looking forward to trying other things . You have to be careful driving here because you will easily pass it as I did , and had to drive back around the block . I recommend you come and the server was very nice . All you need to know is DRIED AND BLAND. My burrito tasted like cardboard. If you've placed cardboard in your mouth, you know what I mean. Texture was similar too.   Oh and they forgot my order. I stood there for 10 mins then someone realized I didn't have my order. OMG, Longhitano's is absolutely disgusting! I've had more satisfactory meals from Arby's than this over hyped pos. Our server was polite but a bit...ditsy & didn't understand the questions we asked or reply with the correct response. I ordered their Alfredo- it smelled & looked terrible upon arrival but I forced myself to at least try it. Huge mistake! When I stabbed it with my fork it was one big massive clump that tasted like it was held together with elmers glue & watered down flour. Although it was luke warm @ best on the surface, it was cold underneath. Even the poor attempt @ garlic bread was laughable. Someone smeared butter on toast & sprinkled too much  garlic salt on it. It's pretty damn bad when Olive Garden's food is more tolerable than this inedible crap.   Our friend ordered their The Biggest Haja Steak Sandwich, this should've been called "The Biggest Hard Turd Sandwich" if they wanted to provide a more accurate description. When he bit into it, he literally could not tear one piece off because it was so tough & rubbery. He tried  sawing at it & the knife didn't even make a dent. When Mike stopped to ask us how everything was, Nate expressed how terrible the meat on the sandwich was @ Mike stood their as if he didn't comprehend a word that was said to him. In fact, he kept cutting Nate off & saying " So it's okay". Naturally, Nate was irritated & said " NO! I can't eat this" & Mike still didn't get it & kept talking over him. Then he walked away...he never apologized nor offered to get Nate something else to eat. He didn't remove the cost from our bill, nothing! When Nate complained to our server he didn't understand either so the nasty sandwich sat there. Our server also saw that my pasta was left untouched but never asked if something was wrong. I get this kid was clearly new to the food service industry but seriously -WTF!?!    My husband had also ordered a drink from the bar when we first sat down, it took our server over 15 minutes to grab it from the bar. Nate had requested a rootbeer, not only did it take over 30 minutes but our server brought out a rootbeer float & charged us extra for the ice cream! Normally I wouldn't suggest this but since the staff was ignoring our complaints, the food wasn't even edible & our patience was gone; I was tempted to leave without paying.   Finally, a seasoned waitress noticed our displeasure & offered to remove Nates sandwich from our receipt. However, she only took 15% off of my alfredo & removed the charge for ice cream but charged us for 2 rootbeers when we only ordered 1. She then explained that all of their staff quit @ the same time & all the new hires are "green". This is still unacceptable & I don't feel that anyone there is competent. Longhitano's is hands down the second worst meal I've had this year! Yum! Wasn't expecting this to be as good or as nice atmosphere wise. With a name like nando's was comparing it to filly bees, much better! Homemade chips and salsa. As a vegetarian I seriously appreciate the ability to order tacos, burrito, or chimichangas with veggies or potatoes! Plus you can't beat pitchers of Dos Equis! I took off a star because their guacamole tastes like it comes from a package. This place gets enough business to use real guacamole. Worth a taste if you're in the area! Fu ck everything in the past...this place is bomb OMG tacos burgers tortas I'm typing with fill belly!!! #FunTacosLV I can't say enough great things about my experience here this past weekend. I had gone to a different location months back and left pretty unsatisfied as it seemed the number one goal of that location was just to try and sell me as much as possible.  When I let them know I was unsatisfied... it was "well we will only charge half the cost for a full hair to lighten it more." I had gone into get my dark brown hair ombré and realized that it may take a few sessions to get it as light as I wanted but when the staff didn't seem to care it turned me off. Needless to say I was scared to try and get my hair done again from this location so I searched yelp and found the location on windmill and pecos had some great reviews..:  I called in the morning and was scheduled shortly after. Brittney was my hair stylist and I had told her about my previous experience... She was shocked to hear about the last experience and assured me I would be happy.  During the whole process she was amazing... explaining every step.  My hair went from literally a line of copper brownish-blonde  to beautifully dimensioned array of highlights and lowlights:  I was so happy by the end and can't wait to go back. Omg this place is amazing! The food was phenomenal, but our server Christina was by far the best part of the meal! She was so outgoing, funny, attentive, and well informed on the menu. Will definitely be back for the food and Christina. I recently moved to Aurora from Texas and I always get my nails done every 2-3 weeks. I walked in into this nail salon as it's near to where I'll be staying to talk to the people in there to explain to them how I get my nails done   and to see if I could make an appointment for the next day.  1. When I walked in no one acknowledged me 2. A guy asked me to walk over to him to talk to him. I thought that was rude because I personally wouldn't want anyone inquiring about their nails whilst I'm getting mine done. He could have excused himself or told me to wait for a few minutes so he could talk to me. 3. When I told him I had a picture and wanted to show him if what I wanted done was something he could do, he rudely said "well we have over 250 nail polishes, you can see if we have those colors." Like really? I then politely asked him if he could replicate the picture I had to which he rudely responded "probably not" no eye contact, no regard of me whatsoever.  Needles to say I walked out thinking how rude! I will NEVER set foot in this establishment to spend my money in there.  Very poor first impression. Extremely rude guy I spoke to. First impressions are everything to me and to most customers. Don't go there unless if you want to be treated like a second class citizen. I tried to treat myself for going to a four-star hotel but it seemed they were holding back on basic amenities and proper service unless you would buy into all the atrocious add-ons that they suggested. No breakfast, no wifi, and when I got into my room all my lamps, TV, phone, etc. were either plugged off or on a timer so that they could save money on electricity. I found this out because I wanted to call guest services to let them know the TV wasn't working, and realized in short succession that the phones weren't working either. That's not just an inconvenience, it's a safety hazard! I had to ride the elevator and walk into the lobby with my slippers, with people glancing at me. I had to stay that way for a LONG TIME, given that I could not find a single person to help me in that big hotel. I ended up having to walk outside to the streets, where I finally got a valet to go inside, call a manager, and waited out my final few minutes while she finally found some time for me.  Four star hotel. Really? Nice place, clean sheets, but unfortunately an unpleasant experience. Great location though. Found this place on Yelp and we couldn't have agreed more with the reviews. This is a tiny hole in the wall next to an asian massage "R&T". I could have driven by this place hundreds of times and never seen it. Ignore the tacky decor, because this place has some of the best carne asada in Phoenix. Start with the chips and salsa and you will see that this isn't your regular taco shop.   We tried the carne asada tacos, carne asada burrito and the chips and guacamole. All delicious. The carne asada is tender and full of flavor. Guacamole and salsas are so fresh and tasty that you will run thru your chips in no time.   We have been to Sonora Grill now a few times and I am just getting around to my review. I think that says it all. Sonora Grill is a must! Just moved to Phoenix. Stopped at Hinckley's for some much needed lighting and fan advice. Was not disappointed!  Bridgett was incredibly knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. Some of my current needs they could meet and for the others Bridgett had great advice. This will be my #1 stop for lighting for as long as I'm in Phoenix. And BTW don't think that because they're specialists that they are more expensive. Prices are very competitive. This is a very fun restaurant with amazing food. I go to the other location just about every day and wanted to give this one a try so I did and was very pleased. It feels like a different restaurant because of the size but it's the same great food and same fun vibe. The staff is great and I will definitely be coming back on the regular to see them.  Come in twice a week till you've tried the entire menu,  i promise you'll be glad you did. Looking at the bad reviews, I was kind of scared before getting the vehicle. I thought I will keep it on hold to experience it and if something goes bad I would try at other rentals.  But the whole process was so smooth. I booked it through Costco Car Rentals so the rental was bit less and I got a decent rate for insurance. Reached at terminal-2 parked my personal vehicle and took the shuttle to the Car rentals place.Reached Budget at 9:30AM to pick up the vehicle, there was one guy in the queue. The rental guy was very friendly and he offered me 3 flavors of the Jeep and he gave me the 2015 model. The vehicle was in excellent condition and make sure you don't mess up with the vehicle while returning.  4 Star because of few issues: - they never picked up the call before I could get my Jeep. - Before I got the Jeep, someone had put chocolates inside the cabinet and the Jeep manual was in lot of chocolate !!!! I wanted to know more about the 4W drive but looks like no one knew how to operate it. I googled it  out and found my answers. Yes one lady came and cleaned the chocolates before I got my Jeep.  Yes I am  impressed about the whole process of Budget Sky Harbor. best fajita in town in my opinion! we have been there twice, and the only thing we ordered was fajita for two with beef only. it was always awesome and delicious. staff was courteous there, and the price was reasonable. We aren't gonna go anywhere else for fajita from now on xD. So this is where all the fabrics I have been looking for are kept! I stumbled on Carol's Fabric Shop when I was working in the area and didn't have a lot to spend. You can bet, though, that I am headed here on my own time. I need more of this. Even though I live 250 miles away, I've told others about it who are going to be in the area and check it out this weekend. I love this place and can't wait until I can come back and really go shopping. I recently moved to AZ and this was my first Saturday night coming to Hooters.  I came right after getting off of work to grab some wings and a beer before heading home for the evening.  I just wanted to say the staff was extremely friendly and fun.  I definitely enjoyed my visit and will be coming back.  Brandi, tending bar, was great to talk to; quick witted and funny.  Food was great, on time and delicious, even though when I walked in, there was a UFC fight going on and the place was packed.  Their ability to get food and drinks out with a full house was refreshing.  I was skeptical at first but they nailed it.  I would recommend this location to anyone. Server was slow but you're at the airport food was decent ! But something happened after wth the server that was not very pleasant ...soooooo they only get 3 stars lol I have been fortune to spend around 20 weekends at the Venetian including the first weekend they opened.  It has always been and still is a class hotel.  It has worn well and looks as good it did that first weekend.  The rooms are all suites and some are bigger then others but even in the smallest suite is larger then most hotels junior suite.  You know this hotel got it's act together when there version of a coffee shop is the Grand Lux Cafe , which is a off shoot of The Cheesecake Factory.  They have great restaurants and shows.  The poker room is one of the best.  See you soon old friend. We had been searching for a new place to get our Maltese and Yorkie groomed since we weren't satisfied with our current groomer. I was a little nervous dropping them off but the ladies there are so nice and reassuring!  We couldn't pick them up until the end of the day and they made sure that my dogs had time to play and run and werent in a cage all day. Their haircuts are exactly what we wanted them to be and they looked so cute! They smelled clean and looked so happy. Will definitely be coming back! Large Cirque du Soleil souvenir Shop with merchandise from Mystere. Store is open even when no shows are going on. Less busy before the show starts. Okay, I know this is supposed to be the "cheap" restaurant in the Wynn, but we're still talking about $18 burgers for lunch, so cheap is relative.  We waited 35 minutes for our food, and of course they got our order wrong.  Did I mention that the place is like half full.  Good thing it wasn't busier, then we might wait an hour for the wrong order.  They of course add 18% for parties of 6 or more so great!  I get to way overpay for the wrong food.  I got lazy and didn't want to leave the resort.  Bad call there. I LOVE fry bread, so I was very excited to try Emerson Fry Bread.  I was not disappointed.  It's definitely not state fair fry bread.  The gentleman who took our order was lively and personable.  The time flies while you wait for your order because he's so entertaining!  I ordered the D$ (chicken & green chile).  It was actually no longer on the menu, but they hooked it up.  And I'm glad they did, because it was delicious!  The fry bread itself was perfect and wouldn't have changed one thing about any of the toppings.  The mixed greens were especially nice...definitely an upgrade from the tasteless iceburg that most places serve.  I will absolutely eat here again.  I have to try the steak! Bad staff...staff was not welcoming at all . I checked in online for my two boys and within 5 mins we were at great clips . On screen we were shown the first to get haircut , however they took other in . When I asked why is that -staff with raised voice this is how it works and you r next -I waited for next one and again they repeated same taking other in before us . With raised tone and bad . I left with my 2boys from there without getting haircut . Will not go again . Bad bad staff....they do not have a curtesy to talk to a customer .  Worst staff Wow! This this is the best burger in town. And I've had a lot of burgers! Service was friendly and fast! When there are SO MANY other choices, why shop from a place that has ZERO customer service and follow up.   This company is run by an absolute A*****E..   They sold me a "Kamado Rocket" which is a beautiful piece of art, but does not work due to terrible metal work, and they have no intention of fixing their $3,000 POS.  DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT do business with this company. They say they are open until 7pm.  It's is 615pm and the guy inside says they are closed.   Won't be wasting my gas to come here again.  THEY CLOSE EARLY! I have been here countless times and keep coming back. All of my friends are hooked too. Delicious salads, bowls, burgers, wraps, and desserts--all vegan! Best items include black bean burrito, buddha bowl, ace of kales salad, quinoa onion rings, sweet potato fries, and the vanilla cupcake. Always busy but totally worth it. I've had the pleasure of dining at the other locations of Yardbird so I was pretty excited to be able to try out their new Vegas location.   I like it, although it definitely departs from the Southern draw of the other location and that authentic kitchen to table feel. We got the usual deviled eggs, chicken and waffles, and cobbler to finish. Overall the chicken was not as great as the Miami location and the cobbler was a bit disappointing. However, the eggs were delicious and waffles were on point!  I will say it's a pretty solid lunch spot so definitely pay a visit when you have a chance. Soooo delicious! With all the burger joints in town, this one is in my top three favorites now! We ate spicy burger and dog, the burger was juicy and flavorful, the dog spicy and different. It is worth the 30 minute trip for us to get there. A cute little place with games, great service and is clean. Was able to get in for 2 pedicures late on a Friday evening. No rushing, no short cuts, very attentive, and finished both our services even after closing time. My husband was very happy with his much-needed pedicure. I also got a gel mani, and my nails are gorgeous. Thank you to Kimberly, for doing an excellent job. Other places will file and file and file your nails down until they are paper thin and practically peeling. But Kimberly kept my natural nails intact. I absolutely LOVE my Easter nails! We will definitely return :) I want this place to do well, because it would be great to have a fancy Mexican option in town. I think they could make this into a pretty solid little restaurant if they fix some problems. The drinks are tasty, but very very heavy on the ice. They are charging drink prices comparable to Boltini down the street, which actually gives you a full glass instead of all this padding. We felt a bit ripped off. I also wish that the specialty cocktail selection had some not-sweet cocktails. One of us got a taco plate and the other got a torta plate. On both, the sides left a lot to be desired. I'm pretty sure our beans and rice were out of a can, and the potato wedges were fresh out of the freezer... The tacos themselves (1 shrimp, 1 fish) were pretty good, though! Only complaint is that they didn't double up on the tortillas, so one of mine fell apart a bit. The steak torta was pretty good, although it would have done well with some pickled chiles.  I am somewhat annoyed that they don't provide free chips with dinner. The entree size isn't that big, which would have been fine if we got chips, but we left feeling hungry. Another rather big oversight is not providing some sort of spicy table salsa. The food wasn't very spicy in itself. Any good Mexican restaurant should have some house salsas.  I think the main problem here is cutting corners in really obvious ways: drinks loaded to brim with ice, no chips, no table salsa, sides are low quality afterthoughts. Even the lack of the doubled up tortilla. Come on guys, tortillas are not expensive. You can afford to give me 4 instead of 2 with my $8 entree.  Another weird thing that was noted by all my dining companions: Pretty much every Mexican joint in the town has Mexican people working the back AND the front of the house, including several restaurants owned by this very same family. Here, the front of house waitstaff is exclusively white skinny blond ladies. That has to be a conscious decision.  I can't help but throw at least some side eye at an establishment that decided that actual Mexican people aren't "classy" enough to wait tables. Let me start by saying I wish that I could give 1/2 stars. I would rate 3 1/2 vs 3. Really better than ok but I'm not sure that it rates 4 stars. It was a good restaurant but had some pretty big negatives.   The first thing that I notice was how large the restaurant was. It seemed to go on forever. Which was amazing considering how quickly our food came out. They have an open kitchen so you can see how many people they have working in the kitchen. Needless to say it's busy.   One drawback as others have mentioned is the noise level. Fortunately my husband and I were sitting by drapery panels so the 2 of us could carry on a conversation. Others sitting more towards the inside of the restaurant would have a difficult time hearing each other. Another issue is that it is pretty dark. I understand ambiance but this was a little too much. They know this so they do compensate and make the print larger on the menu. When it came to eating and my food was the same color (fish and cauliflower) it was hard to tell exactly what I was putting on the fork.  Our server was very good. Attentive and full of information when clarification was needed for the menu. We had Avocado bruschetta which was just okay. I should of skipped it. I ordered the Pacific Sea Bass. The fish was good and so was the cauliflower. They only thing I didn't care for was the preserved grapefruit. The funny thing is that while eating it I said to my husband that I didn't like the orange flavor that I was sometimes getting on the fish. It was either orange or when they preserve it then it totally changes the taste profile from grapefruit to orange. My husband had the lasagna bolognese. He was happy with his choice.  Overall, a good restaurant. I took off since it was extremely dark and loud. Also, the food comes out almost too quick if you just want to sit and talk. The food was good, especially for the price, not excellent. Was absolutely starving we passed this place and decided to give it a try. Prices are decent, fries are fresh cut and amazing, burger was fresh and flavorful.  I would get take our next time because the place was freezing imnot sure they had heat on, not the most enjoyable eating lunch with a jacket scarf and hat on I have stayed in so many hotels in vegas and by far for the money you will not find a better hotel room for $220 on a Saturday night. This room was a one bedroom with two flat screens, a 19inch tv in the restroom, a mini bar a restroom big enough for 20 people, shower and deep tub and  even a second restroom. You could have your own party here and could sleep 4-5 if you had to. Its always a speedy check in and out even when there is a line with 15-20 people. This is the only room I have stayed in for under $250 per night and I actually felt like I was in a fancy upscale suite. These are really cool rooms. What a Shock!  Had Philly Cheese Steaks coast to coast including Philly.  In 55 years of enjoying sandwiches;  This Gilbert Geno's has the distintion of being one of the worst sandwiches I have had.  I got a large on an OK bread with a small serving mix of goo that reminded me of Manwich out of a can.  Or Cincinnati Chili.   Either way, putting the Geno's name on it would make Joey Vento roll in his grave I was not a fan of this location or the staff.  The food was sub par, the service was lacking, and overall it was not a good experience.  For the amount of $$ per dish I expect it to be prepared better I was staying across the street at the Wynn and my post-Disneyland Half Marathon legs weren't really up for a lot of walking, so I suggested we check out TI for dinner. I think the buffet at Treasure Island used to be called Dishes or something and I remembered it being pretty good. Unfortunately, "The Buffet" as it's now known has declined quite a bit in quality.  First, all of the meats are pre-sliced which is crazy. The slices of prime rib were totally dried out and starting to turn grey. The turkey fared a little better, but gravy rescues pretty much everything although either the turkey or gravy was very salty. Speaking of salty, I was curious to try the pho which was, you guessed it, super salty. There is no salad bar here and instead you can get various salads made that looked really good - too bad no one was manning the counter. And finally, the most ridiculous thing of all was the pre-scooped ice cream in dishes which had melted into a soup. On the plus side, the crab legs weren't bad and I enjoyed the mini donuts and chocolate covered strawberries.  I hope this buffet gets their act together soon. Sightly unrelated, but this was my first time at TI in a long time and I couldn't stand the smell of the casino! They pump some weird coconut sunblock smell all over the place which is way worse than stale cigarette air. Yuck Twice now they've let me down at the islington store. I ordered parts that they said they would send from the queen street store and to come in the next day. I arrive and the parts are missing or they've made an error and they never had them. No apologies. I drove quite a distance to this store. That was the last time. They are a confused bunch at the new islington store. Lots of other places to find tools..... Had the lemon grass chicken. It was amazing. The ambience is great ! I highly recommend this if your looking for good Vietnamese A solid 3.5, based on the Chicken Sandwich  I cannot speak about the pizza or pasta, but this sandwich shop is in a really convenient location for me.  I stopped in 'cause I was pressed for time, had to grab a quick dinner, & didn't want Subway/McD's in the plaza.  I asked the girl taking the orders about which was better, either the Panzarotti OR 1 of the sanwiches.  She answered sandwiches and suggested the Chicken.  Chicken was in a schnitzel format, flattened, breaded, & deep fried - actually quite similar to a veal sandwich!  Only 1 size of sandwich here and they were quite substantial, cut in half in which I only ate half for dinner, all for $7.  Cheaper than On-A-Bun.  A slew of toppings (cheese, mushrooms, peppers, etc.) were ALL included for an additional $1.  Not bad if you feel as though you need these additional things.  Hot green peppers were added as I wanted it spicy.  Very good, especially when it's eaten fresh!  No nonsense sandwich place, hopefully healthier than McD's??  ;) Always a good time at this place! You can't beat the live music, great drinks and over all good energy! The fishbowl is a must when you get there, it's by far the best bang for your bucket! I would recommend this place to any and everyone! Pretty stinky service today. Although the food is usually good bar food, we didn't get to place our order today.  No less than 5 servers passed our table while we waited to place our order. Maybe we just caught them in the middle of a shift change. Ended up leaving, but not too upset as we went to Taste of Buffalo where their wing are just better. This was soooo good ! The fish was delicious. Make sure you give them your total rewards card for more points. Everything taste really good. If you're Platinum and up you're drinks are included (alcoholic) but you might as well grab drinks off the casino floor  The ice cream is made in house it's NOT soft serve. There are comfortable booths and tv screens in there. The bathrooms are located OUTSIDE. Ask for directions. It was good. For the 3 of us it was $81 just to give you an idea  I was too busy stuffing my face to take photos. Sorry ! Honestly I just don't get the how everyone is so in love with this place?  I'm not a native so when I moved to the area many years ago everyone advised my family that we absolutely had to try a burnt almond torte from Prantl's.  We did, and to be fair that is a great dessert.  However, I have worked across the street from them for a decade now, and the office ladies I work with have brought in nearly everything they sell at Prantl's over the last decade.  The cookies, the cupcakes, the junior pastries, danishes, donuts, etc... have all made there way into our office, and I have never been wowed by any of them.  In fact I find most items to be pretty sub par.  I think if Prantl's wasn't a true bakery and merely a shop that produced one signature cake it would probably deserve five stars, but that's not the case, and since I have to judge on the totality of their products as a bakery, not only the burnt almond torte which is their claim to fame and recognition, I find them to be quite lackluster overall.  If you want a true bakery treat I would suggest  La Gourmandine for anything, Vanilla for cupcakes, Jean Marc Chatellier, even the somewhat overrated Oakmont Bakery, as other than the burnt almond torte, you are paying specialty bakery prices but getting Giant Eagle quality, which is fine, but at that point you might as well go to Giant Eagle and pay accordingly. I had lunch at the buffet and it was by far the best buffet I've had in Vegas to date (I've travelled here quite often). The choices at lunch time are a bit overwhelming as they had full breakfast choices with omlette station, sushi bar, meat carving station, pastas, deserts, and the list goes on and on. My only dissappointment was that I could not eat more.  Best $20 buffet/variety you can have on the Strip. This place is so awesome! The food is so good, I haven't had crepes this good in years! People are friendly and they have a good barista along with a ton of different drinks. Only down side is they are only open until 2 :( We were looking for Lancasters and ended up here.. which was good bc the food was pretty good!   I had the philly with onion and mushroom and white american cheese and the homemade chips and it was all delicious. The sandwich had a lot of flavor without being really greasy (as cheesesteaks often are) and the chips were a good mix of crispy and soft that I expect when I'm getting homemade chips.   Other dishes at the table - chicken club sandwich (reportedly VERY good) and a cheeseburger (reported as Ok, but he ate it all so it couldnt have been too bad!!)  Note: They had the BEST Sweet tea I've had in a few years. Really super delish. I'd definetely go back here. The last time I gave this place a try, the food sucked and I gave it 2 Stars.  On a recent Vegas trip my flight was at a gate nearby and I decided to give them another chance.    This time around, the food still sucked, but the employees are even worse.  Here's what happened....I ordered the following items:  Bean, Rice, Cheese Burrito $6.99 Bottle of Diet Pepsi $3.19  Since I had a backpack and other stuff in my hand, I forgot the bottle of Diet Pepsi at the counter after I paid for the meal.  I went to the counter to get settled in a spot to eat and get napkins, utensils, etc.  5 minutes later, they called my number for my Burrito....I was starving, so I started to eat it.  After a few bites, I noticed that I didn't have my soda....where was it?  I looked around, went back to the counter.....the employees looked at me but didn't say anything.  I walked around again looking for it....then I said to the girl cashier "I think I left my Soda somewhere, have you seen it?"  She said "No" then looked at one of the guys and said something in Spanish to him.  He said, "Oh, I think I have it.  I found it on the counter".  I watched as he reached into his backpack and gave it back to me.....WTF?!  I think they do this all the time, watch for people to leave stuff behind and then take it.  The appalling thing is that I was still in the restaurant!    I didn't say anything to them...it would've done no good anyway.  Once a thief, always a thief.  That does it for me, I will never eat here again.  Return Factor - 0% Came here for brunch with friends for the Downtown Tempe Brunch Crawl, and it was very crowded. I don't think the food was anything too special.  SERVICE: SLOW. In their defense the place was pretty packed but all the dishes came out at separate times :(   AMBIENCE: indoor and outdoor seating though be careful with outdoors because it is HOT in the summer and very few shaded areas   FOOD: for the brunch crawl there were $3 bloody Mary's, $3 bloody Maria's, and $3 breakfast tacos. We got an assortment. The food was good but nothing huge to write home over and the tacos were tasty but nothing too special. This shop combines coffee, breakfast and coffee break items and a yarn shop (which made my wife happy). During a recent visit we enjoyed well made asparagus and ham quiches with well dressed side greens. There were three regular and one decaf offerings from two area roasters. Service was friendly and helpful. They had great food try the SantaFe Skillet delicious. But they have a tremendous waiter, named David. This gentleman belongs in a 5 Star restaurant with out a doubt, he made the evening for me and my family. The night shift, wow what service. Just go one time you will walk out with a smile, Dennys is really lucky to have this guy:) Wgag a great pleasure, thank you David!! ... and having been back again a few days ago, I will leave my rating as 3-stars. The service was faster this time and the food was okay, but I really don't find anything special about it. I had a bowl of the Witch's Brew chowder which was pretty good, and the coleslaw that I missed the first time. Overall, I would say that the food is on par with other places that I have had fish and chips, although a little more expensive than some. I might return if in the area, but wouldn't travel across town just to go back. I have been here way too many times, and we are over it.  I will say prices are good on both food and drinks, but you get what you pay for.  On two occasions we had large parties (15+) who all are and drank a lot, and we had horrible service.  They acted like w were a bother, when actually we probably spent close to $800 that night in total.  Very disappointing.  We will not be back. Ended up there for beer week. Atmosphere is great although pretty loud. Had the calamari, octopus, and wings appetizers. First two were really good bites though small portions. Wings were spicy but not special. Looking forward to them opening up the butcher shop. Boarder grill has pretty good food, but I've had just ok meals there too. Considering the prices I'd expect every meal to be exceptional but I haven't been blown away every time. It's a special place for the wife and I so we do enjoy going. The drinks are pretty amazing and I leave stuffed every time. I suggest anything with steak in it and you can't go wrong. Not a fan of red meat? Go for the carnitas. I was still too full from lunch at The Coffee Cup in Boulder City to eat a whole dinner. I had the white sangria, excellent. Also the salad with the Asian pear and blue cheese crumbles. The dressing was mango, and delicious. But the best part were the desserts. We had the pineapple upside down cake w. coconut ice cream, and the chocolate molten cake, with raspberry coulis and vanilla ice cream. WOW! Both were just awesome. We don't have anything comparable to the pineapple upside down cake in Boston, it was fantastic. Service was excellent! I have never had such lagging and unprofessional contact w a rental company. The contracts are illegal and not beneficial to anyone but them. I would get a lawyer involved when dealing w either Constance or Eric. Not so good. Extremely slow service.  Chicken not very tasty. Instant mashed potatoes. Gravy no flavor.  As we were eating there were 15 people waiting in line for service.  Pretty expensive for what you get.  We wont be back. This place gives buffets a good name. The food is always fresh and interesting. The breakfast and brunch are possibly the best in Las Vegas. The Friday and Saturday night gourmet dinner buffet, is unreal. Try Beef Wellington, Venison and Steak Tartar just to name a few. We were searching for a local Peruvian restaurant and found this place on Yelp. It was the midafternoon, so the atmosphere was subdued. Some may refer to this place as a "hole in the wall," but the antiquated interior was much more conducive for large groups than their former location not too far away. During our visit, the green-colored décor included a large mural, blue-checkered floors, TVs, and three rows of tables stretched across the dining area.  Santi and I started with the Ceviche de Pescado ($12.95) that came with slices of tilapia stacked and marinated in lime juice, spices, lettuce, yam, red onions, and Peruvian corn. The tilapia was fresh, nicely seasoned with lime juice without it being too overpowering. The spices were nicely embedded, and accompanied well when eaten with the sharp onions and sweet lettuce. The Peruvian corn and yam were delicious too. At first I was concerned about the portion size, but the fish turned out plentiful and worthwhile.   We then shared Pollo Saltado ($11.95) made with chunks of chicken sautéed with chopped tomatoes, french fries, red onions, cilantro, mignonette and soy sauce, and a side of steamed rice. The profile of the sauce was on point to bolster the flavors of the chicken. The red onions and tomatoes also nicely contributed to the profile of this dish. The fries were tasty, fried to perfection, and I was glad the cuts were on the thicker side to soak up the sweet-savory flavors. I only wished the fries were cooked down a little more with the onions and tomatoes. It met my expectations.  The Seco de Res ($13.95) was made with stewed beef loin in cilantro sauce, green peas, and served with fried yucca, salsa criolla, and Peruano beans. The beef was very nicely seasoned with wine and other spices. It was nicely stewed, tender, but also had lots of dry spots. The use of green peas gave a nice sweet dimension to this dish. The salsa criolla and fried yucca also have some textures and sharp bites to the refined beef loins. We both loved the Peruano beans. It was nicely cooked down, subtly sweet, and flavorful.   We were also given a side of roasted Peruvian corn with aji sauce. The sauce appeared more like a chunky salsa than the creamy smooth type I usually find in restaurants.   The flavors were far-reaching, but there were a number of limitations worth noting. First, unlike most Peruvian restaurants, Tumi does not offer fresh bread as a starter for the meal. Secondly, service was friendly and courteous throughout the meal. But, for whatever reason the server personally wrote the tip into our bill before delivery it to our table, an act I find unusual, offensive, and disrespectful. Ironically, we were going to give her a bigger tip until this happened.  The server did however, give us two coupons for $10 off each time we return to order at least $15 worth of food. Given the nice gesture, I was willing to give her some benefit of the doubt, but it still negatively influenced my rating of the experience.  Interested diners should know that Yelp currently has a $10 for $20 deal at one voucher per table. I would be interested in returning to try their Anticuchos, Ceviche de Mixto, Cau Cau, Aji de Gallina, and Chaufa de Camaron. Great spot for a quick coffee, latte, cap, and of course Japanese style cold brew. Good selection of pastries and snacks. Right in the heart of downtown PHX, they even have a lovely patio to enjoy your morning starter. Love this little liquor store. Close to the house. Excellent customer service, and I love that its a family owned small business. I come here about 3-4 times a week average (bc I have a drinking problem. haha) I just never check in bc I forget. So far, they usually have the stuff I need.. lots of wine, beer, vodka,  mixers... you name it. If they dont have something, just ask. My brother in law wanted a certain beer which they didnt have and the owner specially ordered it for him. And now he always has his beer in stock. This owner really cares about keeping his customers happy... which keeps us loyal! Enjoy! Got here around 1:45, waited in line for about 15, not bad.  Bad happens now.  The placed jam packed and I cannot locate my friends for over half an hour.  They were playing pretty good music, too bad I couldn't enjoy myself because I was on a mission to find my friends.  I find my friends, one of them is drunk, super drunk.  Within five minutes of meeting them, one of them pukes and next thing I know is we are being forced to leave.  Did I mention I had to pay $30 + service fee to get in????  But that was just my luck, I can't blame the venue for things like this.  Would have been better if they granted re-entry upon the rest of us returning to the pool - no. Sure there are rules and one of them happens to be no re-entry, but absolutely no flexibility?  Especially at a place where bouncers ask for $200 to bribe them (yes, this apparently happened earlier in the day to my friends).  It's a nightmare trying to take care of a drunk person and get the belongings (one coat check, meaning we had to take other people's belongings too).  You are not allowed in the hotel unless you have your bottoms on (reason why we had to get everyone's stuff).  I was handed the room key and room number via text because we thought it would be easier to get back in (although chances were very slim) as opposed to two.  The security calls for paramedics and they come to do their simple check up.  I was pissed and annoyed but they were doing their job so no complaints from a sober person point of view so that was okay.  We got the okay to go and I took the friend up to the room.  I get back to the Beach Club and explained I had my other friends' stuff AND the room key without which they will not be able to get back into the hotel.  I cannot reach the other friend with a phone.  Shoot, I'm thinking I'm not coming to Vegas again.  One of the security people approached me and asked how my friend was, HOW WONDERFUL HE ASKED! Because I also explained to him my current situation and he talked to the other people at the door and they let me in. See?  There is the reasonable flexibility.  (hence, two stars, not one)  So here is my real experience at Encore Beach Club:  There is just too many people.  You are just standing in water jumping up and down OR doing the same thing outside the pool.  It is too packed.  Getting drinks at the bar is unimaginable - the line is just insane.  With that many drunk people still drinking, who knows how much pee is present in the water???  The lifeguards are annoying as hell, blowing the whistles for every single thing - no splashing, etc.  They all go insanely crazy when a guy gets on the stripper pole area even for a second, I thought an arrest was about to be made with so many whistles going off.  If you have no issues dropping the dough you could spend purchasing a very decent DSLR, go for the tables and cabanas with wait service.  Otherwise, not worth the entrance fee.  By entering here though you have a full excuse to be at the douchiest level possible for guys or to act as if you have no brain for girls so if that's what you want (seemed like that's what everyone else wanted at this place), go here without the $$$$$.  Standard party goers in Vegas but this place by far the worst.  Lock box is available for $20 by the entrance.  Not going back. Buyer beware!!! If you buy a car from this place They sell it to you as is. Meaning they don't inspect the vehichles for mechanical issues. My girlfriend purchased a car 3 weeks ago Ned's new tires oil pan is stripped out and leaking oil, cv boot is ripped, cam seals are leaking. They gave her a 1 month warranty from Edmonds that was completely worthless, the denied her claim. She drove the car back to cali and has had issues ever since I have only been here a few times now but it is the closest bowling alley to my home and I have kids so there you go.  I never had a problem here and my kids like bowling and the game zone which all cost me a pretty penny but this is a business.  Soda here is almost as much as the movie theater and the food isn't all that good but that is not why you come here.  I will go back when the kids ask and I am grateful to have a nice clean location for bowling near my home. Awesome place. Clubhouse salad is my favorite. Only place that I know of where the chicken is warm. What a nice touch. Nice size serving. Like that they put a pitcher of iced tea on the table. Keep up the great work! One word:  Amazing!!  Real southern food - will NOT disappoint.  And I know southern!  Chef Austin took great care of our group for my Bday celebration in Vegas. Not easy to please everyone at a large table of picky eaters looking for a taste of home!  Fried chicken was perfection - seasoned so well!  Can't wait to return. Horrible service. They took the orders of people who came in after me.  Then they served people who ordered after me.  I felt like they ignored me because I was on my own. I waited for over 30 minuted then they said the kitchen messed up.  If you are going to keep your customers happy , hire more staff that know what they are doing. Average food and service. Kind of dirty and some flies going around. Was ignored by two staff members when I walked up to ask a question. Plastic cups, bowls, and chopsticks. Great BBQ!!!  Truly like that I grew up on in Alabama and Georgia!  The variety and quality of the sides add to the experience all the more.  I just wish they had the amazing peach cobbler everytime I visit!  It's as close to Grandma's as your going to get!  :-) We were there in the morning on a Saturday, the line for the place stretched around it and back to the elevators. Clearly 45 minutes. This is sort of a fast food situation, not a sit down restaurant, and by that I mean you buy the food and fight for a place to eat at a very few seating options. I'm sure the food is good based on these reviews, but don't make a special trip to go here if you are in the area, like we did. We ended up going somewhere else. No eggsluttiness for us, unfortunately. I have gone to this place for years, and will go back but never to Jen.... Lets just say I had an eyebrow disaster. I will never tint again here. I asked for a light brown and I looked like Bert and Ernie. Awful and right before engagement photos.... We went because of the high recommendations. I wish we would have walked out as soon as we saw the tacky decor. Each meal is large enough to feed an entire family if that family wants a low quality meal. They definitively stress quantity over quality.  I suggest passing on this one. We just returned here for our second visit on New Year's Eve (our first visit was a NYE a few years back), and I'm just as in love with the place as I was before.  Sure, it's a splurge (which is why we only end up here on New Year's Eve), but it's a worthy splurge.  This NYE, they had a prix fixe menu, in addition to a smaller-than-normal regular menu, but since we are samplers, we decided to each get the 5-course prix fixe so we could try as many things as possible.  I love that a trip to Sonoma Grille is not just dinner, it's an entire event.  Our waitress, Barb, was fantastic - knowledgeable about the menu, and passionate about it too.  They had just introduced some new items, so the servers had recently done their menu taste-test, and to hear her describe everything was like being there in the room as each dish was sampled and explained.  Sonoma Grille is regularly recognized as having one of the best wine selections in the city, and it's true.  The markup is a bit much, but again, you're paying for atmosphere and experience in addition to good California wines (I'd love to see a bit more Central Coast, as that's my favorite wine region, but the name is 'Sonoma,' so I give them a pass).  The staff can answer any question you have about the wine, which I really appreciate.  We started with the 'Trio of Amuse' appetizer, which had a parsnip bisque (light and flavorful), some oysters (which weird me out a bit, I must admit), and a teeny tiny beef carpaccio that was perfect in every way.  It was just one little nibble, but it was an insane burst of flavor.  While we were enjoying our wine and appetizer, the bread server came around with a selection of four different kinds of bread.  Instead of an individual table serving being brought to your table, a server comes with a large basket and serves you a few pieces of your choosing, plus olive oil for dipping.  I don't know why, but I love this little unique aspect of this restaurant.  For the larger appetizer (oh yes, two appetizers), we each got the jumbo lump crab and avocado plate.  This was gigantic - we could have easily split one between the two of us.  The crab pieces were huge, easily the size of garlic bulbs.  My only suggestion for this would be to have a few pieces of the crostini instead of just a little sliver at the bottom.  The actual plate was quite juicy, and the crunch of the crostini was a good balance.  Mmm, this was like crab guacamole, so in other words, amazing.  My husband and I each got different salads.  He opted for the fois gras salad (which he loved, even though I was a bit too squeamish to sample it), and I got what I shall refer to as the pile 'o beets.  Anyone who knows me knows my love affair with beets, and this was just perfect.  Slices of beets interspersed with goat cheese and well-seasoned... wish I could eat that every day.  Not very 'salad-y' but heavenly nonetheless.  There were five different options for entrees, but we both had our eye on only one thing: the filet mignon.  Oh. My. Word.  This steak was cooked to perfection - so tender and juicy that my mouth is watering just remembering it!  It came with garlicky whipped potatoes and broccolini (which I delicately pushed to the side - sorry broccoli, we're never going to be friends).  The portion was huge, and I had the second half wrapped up for lunch the next day.  We were nearly too full for dessert, but had to make room to try the chocolate ravioli.  It's a little weird, and the texture is a bit chewier than I would have thought, but the flavor was excellent.  It came with a nice blend of raspberry and vanilla sauce for dipping, and was perfect alongside a steaming cup of coffee.  All in all, we had another excellent experience.  Barb even offered to keep my leftovers in the fridge until after the midnight festivities, but I was afraid I'd forget in the massive crowd leaving downtown, so we walked it back to the car anyway.  I was not going to let myself miss out on a second meal of that filet in the aftermath of Pittsburgh fireworks lol.  This is one NYE tradition we plan on keeping for many years to come! By far the best Mexican food we have had in Las Vegas. The fideo soup was loaded with flavor and so we're the salsas. We ordered the lunch combinations so we could try a variety and we were not disappointed by any of them. The service was impeccable, we will definitely be back soon. Pretty unique place! The food was awesome, and I met O.J. Simpson in the order line! Haha! True story.... First, the good things.  The Chili Chicken is awesome.  My wife and I both love it as it is spiced well and different than what we have had at other restaurants.  The Nan was also fluffy and not greasy. The Peas Palau was also unique with fruit and nuts.   Now the challenges.  I have been here several times and although they say Dosa on the online  menu and also on some signs in the restaurant, I have yet to be there when they can actually serve it. The beans in the Chana Masala were undercooked both times we ordered it.  They also don't make Dall.  What Indian restaurant doesn't make Dal?  Still too early to give them 2 stars but hope they get consistent on what they can serve. I set up an appointment the night before and came in at 1pm on a Saturday. There was no wait. Charlie did my full set and his work looks great and he worked so diligently. I definitely will be coming here from now on. I get mani/pedis, waxing and lashes.  The technicians are professional and friendly.  The salon is clean and trendy.  If it wasn't for the receptionists at the front desk  (or should back desk), I may have given a 5 star review. I have to say that I've never encountered such a rude, unfriendly, caustic group of women.  I've been told that this is a common complaint and that the owner knows, but doesn't care. Honestly, you can't go wrong. The quality is consistent across all the chains and reliable to whatever you may be used to.  I do have one tip to customers. I made an online order with the steak meat on the side. NEVER ORDER THE MEAT ON THE SIDE.  I'm pregnant so I can't have raw meat, but I love chipotle. I didn't want to be a pain so I figured I'd just order it on the side and cook it to well done at home.  I only got a TINY little plastic tub of meat...I asked the lady at the register,"this is the meat on the side??" She almost looked ashamed and said,"uhh, yea.."  *there's a photo reference.  Needless to say, I'm sure once I can eat undercooked meat again I'm sure I'll be back. Just sorta sucked because you pay so much for their food, you'd think they'd have larger containers nearby. Plus I know this is a special request.  Oh well...lesson learned. This is the only old time boot store around. I walked in there. I was greeted my a white gentleman in this 50's. He was very friendly. He asked me what I was looking for and found me three different pairs of work boots to try on. He sat me down. Measured my foot. Brought out three different pairs of boots. Laced up my boots. Put my foot in the boots with a shoe horn. Then laced up both boots. I walked around and decided on a pair. I Thought this kind of service was gone. RED WINGS IS THE ONLY BOOTS STORE THAT STILL HAS SERVICE THE WAY IT USED TO BE. This place is awesome!! The white gentleman is awesome!! GOOD PRICES,GREAT SERVICE,WELL MADE BOOTS!! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE. This restaurant was really good & we all had a wonderful dining experience with our large group. Excellent & attentive service, fresh & flavorful ingredients, nice plating of entrees, and walked out of there full & happy. Would definitely go back again. They are so nice and do such a wonderful job, really paying attn. to detail. I will drive across town to come here. I prefer the younger lady for the pedi. She really takes her time and massages your legs a lot. My kids took me here for my birthday dinner.   I had the gigantic pork chop and generous helpings of mashed potatoes and rice. Yes, I know that's a LOT of starch but one of them was a substitute for -- I think -- Brussel sprouts, which I do NOT eat.  But it was DELICIOUS.  I had been craving a pork chop for months.   Thanks Harevey's for a great night. I've been to many of the Day Clubs in Vegas. Hands down, Encore Beach Club aka EBC is one of the best day clubs you can go to. One of the MAIN reasons why this is one of the best is that they actually have Gaming Tables. Most Day Clubs don't (actually, I don't think any other day clubs have gaming tables, with the exception of XS but that is a nightclub). So if you're a gambler like me, you're gonna want to go here. Also, If you're going to book a table, I recommend booking the Lilypads. Why? Its on the water so you can chill on your Lilypad and hang out in the water. Best of both worlds in my opinion! You can't order food from your Lilypad but you can order food from the grill and BRING it to your lilypad. So you're good! If you're going to book any tables at EBC, make sure you go through a reputable promoter. I HIGHLY recommend booking with the EBC VIP host Brian Pfeiffer (773) 459-8133 - His cell phone. Just text him! He is AMAZZZINNNGG. He will walk you in, he will make sure you're all good and he will answer all your questions. Just went to Vegas this past weekend and had a blast. The food was good but not for the price we paid. It's good for a gas station as well. The corn was under cooked for sure. I did like the BBQ beans a lot. I do feel for the amount you spend it should knock your socks off or taste like you cooked it at home. I do it a 3.5 but it wouldn't let me do that on the stars. Honestly the looks the girls give my fiancé and myself when we come in for each appointment is disgusting, to feel judged and looked at a certain way for absolutely no reason bugs me to no end, they don't know my life they don't know her life they don't know our ages or one single thing about either of us, to add on to that we have had 3 reschedules for 2 appointments now, 2 reschedules for one single appointment in which we were pushed out one week further and again one week further until they got their stuff figured out and can successfully schedule a consistent appointment schedule, we had our first ultrasound today and the woman who did the ultrasound was just an angry woman in which you are putting your trust in to measure and check your babies health and anatomy, she was rude to my fiancé when my fiancé was asking one simple question she replied with I need to focus right now, just let me do these measurements, to add to this whole ordeal, the environment of this office is just not good at all, who watches murder shows on TV with children present in the lobby and blood and gore all over the screen? We were anxiously anticipating an answer on the blood work we did from our last appointment and was not given a single answer and why you ask? Because they showed that we missed our appointment to get it done and we were told that we needed to get it done ASAP, well if you guys actually communicated to the lab office and did your paperwork correctly you would have seen that we went in a did do the lab work just as you told us to do so, we do our part as parents and are consistent with our things in life, don't try to blame us for missing an appointment to get the most important lab work done, which was testing for Down syndrome and other birth defects, would have really loved to know the results to the blood work for our first child. Thanks! One last thing, to the girl who has the short black hair at the front desk and the dermal on her neck who keeps giving myself and my fiancé dirty looks, if you don't like what you do then get a different job and quit staring you may be unhappy but don't make everyone's life as miserable as yours, all of these reviews speak for themselves I would suggest going somewhere else, ANYWHERE else than this place, I would avoid this place at all costs, save yourself the headaches and anger from the disrespectful girls at the front desk This review is not for the food or dining, it's only for the reservation & host/management experience.  In short, making a reservation means nothing!  I reserved a table for 4 on Saturday night at 7:15pm to welcome my colleagues to a nice meal while staying at the M Resort & Casino.  It was crowded when we arrived, and the host snapped at us saying it would be another 30 minutes for our reservation. I asked if we could go to the bar while we wait, and she said there was no room there either.  So we went to a Casino bar & came back 30 minutes later, and the manager told us it'd be at least another 30 minutes.  They weren't at all polite, they acted like we were being a pain for coming back. SERIOUSLY?!  So I asked them to take my number down & call me when the table was ready, and she begrudgingly did.  Well, they NEVER called me to say our table was ready.... good thing we snagged one at the Burger & Brews place next door.   Clearly, Anthony's doesn't know how to manage their reservations.... obviously an OpenTable reservation doesn't guarantee you a table.  We were super let down because the menu looks great, but I can't comment on that. the ice cream is great but the owner is very rude. everytime i go in there she always have something rude to say. the ice cream gets 5 stars and the owner gets no stars! This place impressed me. It is in kind of a bad location not noticeable from the street on Pleasant Valley and Broadview road however through word-of-mouth I've heard about this place and when I went... Wow. Some of the best sushi I've ever had, The Chinese food on the menu was much better than 90% of the Chinese places in the area.  The quality of the food was exceptional. I keep on craving this place but just haven't got back yet. I will be back for sure So... arrived at ~5:30 and sat outside... ordered by 5:35... then we waited... and waited... and waited. No one checked on us (2 people) until 6:15. At that point, we asked for our food to go. Got that and the checks at 6:20. Finally able to pay and leave by 6:30. Probably some of  the worst service I have received. At least if you are running behind or food is taking awhile, you come back and explain and/or apologize. Instead, we were left wondering and waiting for our food. Obviously that never came until we said we were going to leave and take it with us. You would think at that point they would have apologized or taken something off the check, but no, nothing. Chances are, I won't be back. That is unfortunate, as we spend a lot of time in the area and this would have been a great outdoor spot! To top it off, when I got home and opened the soggy boxes, I was very disappointed at what I paid $11 for. Today was my first time at Naked BBQ, and I can gladly say that it won't be my last. The chopped brisket sandwich is amazing!! Seriously... You need to try it!!  Wayne was such a great help! He was very well-mannered and took the time to ask how the meal and experience was. He definitely made the experience better. The pièce de résistance, however, had to be the BBQ sauce. It was so good, I had to go and buy my own bottle. I'll be back again real soon! I waited almost five months for them to look at my knee .when I arrived for my appointment there was a line ,so I waited patiently .when I finally gave the person at the desk my information I was told I I was late for my appointment and would have to be rescheduled, the next appointment was six months away.first,I arrived well before the fifteen minutes requested by them before the actually appointment .second,i did not appreciate the comment on my cheap government insurance ....it's not my fault I was forced on it ....after reading some of the other horrible reviews I am quite happy I am not one of their patients. Best veggie hoagie I've ever had! Way better than going to subway and getting something bland and run of the mill :) Very good but a little pricey though. The fire in the bar area is very cool though. The food is good. Very nice place First time in this place. Pretty impressive. I liked the lemon popcorn chicken with green onions..good flavor and sauce. The soy garlic chicken wings were a little too sweet actually, I wish they were a little less sweet and more garlicy. Bimbap was excellent. Delicious and very comforting. Of course all the sides great as usual with Korean Cuisine. Overall, we were pretty happy. Service was good, even though I've never been a fan of pressing a button to get the server's attention. I am not sure where that started but it's a bit  awkward and not very classy. Would come back and have a few other things on the menu. Food is average. Service is mostly good.   Tried almost every breakfast plate as well as the burgers.  Look elsewhere for good eats. Other than being served pretty cold (through the drive thru), the food wasn't that bad.  Would have been way better warm though. Management here is consistently unprofessional and argumentative with customers. One especially is Tyler Sims; we aren't sure. He hides his name tag. We've witnessed this with how they have handled others complaints as well our own. Less clean than most other Harkins. It's a newer theatre but it's been run into the ground. Routine disappointment. We recommend the Harkins theatres at Park West or Arrowhead. I don't think I've ever had this type of cuisine before, what a treat. Got there around 8 and it was packed with indians and hipsters ;) The vegetarian dosa is quite good, we also the lamb biryani. Had to wait a little for a table but service was fast and friendly. Cozy campus, nice building, friendly community. But fundamental sciences (math, physics, astronomy) do not receive enough attention they deserve. CMU has an ​unexpectedly high bias on its subjects: too much emphasis on computer science! If CMU thinks big and plans to become a world-renowned​ engineering school, fundamental sciences must be emphasised. Bought my gear there for years, and did so up until the long haired hippy guy looked at me the minute I walked in and said rudely, " take of your backpack and leave it up front". Seriously, really. The amount of time it takes to take that off and put it on, takes forever. Am I really going to shove something into a backpack that's fastened to my back? No other stores have ever asked me to remove my backpack ever, specially some hippy long haired ass wipe. You guys went down hill fast. NEVER, ABSOLUTELY NEVER WILL I STEP ONE FOOT INSIDE YOUR STORE AS LONG AS I BREATH AIR. Oh, and BTW, I went that day and bought my helmet of decent people, AZMotorsports. Yeah it was more expensive, but they were polite, and they actually knew about the products. Perhaps the high turnover in staff is a hint of a deeper lying issue. Keep your BILT crap, and your crappy service from long haired hippy morons! First time but not our last!! Never knew it was there and authentic,friendly staff..amazing food!! OK - we were so sad and bummed when Momma Mias didn't come back. It was our go-to pizza place and it killed us! The we found out about this and were sooooo excited. Now normally, I think you would want places to be different or unique or doing their own thing, but I am so happy that these guys kept to the simple amazing pizza they had before! It was so good and so nice to have something close and back that we love! The wings were great too! Delivery was wicked fast!   Guess we will be back to Sunday night pizza again :) Great little park in the midst of downtown Pittsburgh. A lot of different walking trails, food vendors and a nice place to just chill with friends. Our group met up here for a little tour through downtown Pittsburgh and it was a convenient initial meeting point to get us started.  There's a great view of the Cathedral of PIttsburgh from the plaza and some great potential photo's for us tourists. There's also opportunity to play disc golf here and you'll often see artists, University students, hipsters, families just hanging out in the park.  The only downside is the downtown parking, although there is plenty of pay parking surrounding the plaza at $2/hour. This place is located at the heart of Eastern so it's always packed. Food is mediocre. Ordering is very confusing and there was no staff to ask or usher the guests in. With the music too loud, you actually have to shout to the food preparers what you want to order. Pricing was not too bad, though. I was really, REALLY disappointed in the staff. I had gone THREE times to find a dog and the first two times the dogs I was interested in were adopted which was fine. So Wednesday I called and I asked about one of the dogs and the lady on the phone told it wouldn't be ready till Friday. I rearranged all my plans for Friday morning. They don't open till 11AM, I get there at 9:30AM. I was the first in line and waited for an hour and a half. I was the first person to walk in the door and ask about the dog and she said well we have to wait to see if anyone else would like to see the dog and so of course there was someone else. Mind you- this person shows up 20 minutes before they opened and I waited an hour and a half... and what happens? They do a raffle and she ends up getting the dog. They claim they are first come, first serve which is NOT true at all... False advertising and they really need to stick to what they say. I will not be returning and I will make sure that I let others know what horrible service I experienced while I was there. Truly unfair and not right. First time ordering from them, the wings are really good and I also got the pig snackers... the texture of both are amazing, just a tad crunchy... amazing, but the fries were waaaaay  waaaaay too salty. I know they would be the best fries, if they had a dash of salt instead of a pale of salt. Besides all that, I will def be coming back. Good selection of specialty pizzas. $18 range on large but very tasty for hand tossed pizza. Since everyone in my family digs Tandoori Times, I've wandered in for eight or nine earlybird dinners and, honestly, I'm a little underwhelmed.  Definitely not bad or awful, but maybe if I sandwiched a later supper  between undulating bare bellied vixens and a couple of Kingfishers, I'd stumble out with a hazier (and happier ) overall impression.    Nothing I've ever eaten here was truly bad enough to take back - or savory enough to inspire a return visit. Portions tend to be small and sauces are, by and large, mild and rather one dimensional.  Other than the garlic naan, I cant  remember a dish smelling really awesome as it wafted by, which is a shame considering Indian cuisine is among the world's most aromatic.     I was eager to share yesterday's lamb boti kabob, as the portion was good sized - about 15-20 small cubes of lamb (not mega kabob sized cubes, but a very respectable portion for $10-11), on the usual tandoori bed of onions and peppers.  The lamb exterior was nice & crusty, but the inside wasnt moist and tender like you'd expect from tandoori - instead it was hard, chewy and disappointing.  Companion's entree was 3 tiny vegetable fritters or dumplings buried in a thick sauce, that looked more like an appetizer.  Chicken dishes are generally better - the tandoori version is good, and similar to most Indian joints.  I recommend the three hot relishes (red sauce, green puree, and pickled peppers) provided tableside, as house preparations, at least in my experience, tend to be mild.   Servers are generally Anglo, pleasant and competent during the meal, but just about every time we walk in for dinner at 5 or 5:30, the entire operation seems almost startled by our presence. Nobody's overtly rude, but instead of a really warm welcome, you kind of get four or five employees hanging out at the bar staring at you, as if mentally choosing straws to see who has to deal with the first dinner customer of the evening. It's not oppressive, but it's happened more than once and I'm not crazy about the vibe.    I do like the complimentary, self serve chai tea and open kitchen, providing an opportunity to stretch one's legs and socialize a bit. Nice touches.   The menu is extensive, all told about sixty items, and reasonably priced for Indian food. Indian textiles, jewelry and artwork is often on display, for sale, and the house music is too loud if you have the misfortune to be seated under a ceiling speaker. It got turned down, eventually, but any restaurant with a few years under it's belt ought to understand customary American tolerances better than that.    The atmosphere is up and down. Food's OK. Service is OK. Ask my family and they'll each give it four or five stars. In my book, Tandoori Times is just OK. Before we went to see "Love" at the Mirage, my boyfriend and I came in for 7 pm dinner reservations at Onda.  We've lived on Maui for a few years now, and it's almost impossible to get our hands on good Italian food.  I came into Onda hoping to be wowed, and I was not disappointed.  The bar area is small, brightly lit and walled with wine cases, while the dining area is dark and quiet with plush booths.  We were greeted by our server right away who was incredibly helpful as we negotiated the extensive wine list.  He made recommendations and brought us tastes.  We really appreciated his expertise and helpfulness.  After we ordered wine, we started with the Meatballs Appetizer.  Two were served on a platter with a homemade marinara sauce, topped with golden crusted goat cheese.  What a perfect way to start our dinner.  This is a must-order.  We also split a Caesar Salad.  Large leaves of romaine, not chopped, and perfectly dressed with some of the best croutons I've ever had.  For our main meal, we took our server's suggestion and ordered the Burrata Agnolotti Pasta and the Veal Osso Bucco.  The pasta was served with chunks of lobster and sauteed chanterelle mushrooms in a roasted corn butter sauce.  The veal slid off the bone when I used my fork (I barely had to touch my knife at all, the veal was so tender), and the accompanying saffron risotto was incredible.  Needless to say, the dinner was incredible.   We ordered the Tiramisu for our dessert and practically licked the plate clean.  Earlier during our meal, when we were deciding what to order the sommelier informed us that they do all the pasta dishes to order.  Each pasta is handmade in the restaurant and cut to order, so, upon request, they will do half orders of all of their pasta entrees in case you can't choose just one.  Next time I make it to Vegas, I'll have to take them up on their offer.  Amazing food, wonderful service.  You won't be disappointed at Onda. The meal is decent. We ordered a chicken souvlaki and the chicken was freshly grilled and the potatoes was in good portion.  The greek salad that came with it was a little disappointing. They didn't even use greek dressing on it. I think it was just italian or something. Not that great, I used some of the tzatziki sauce as dressing.   Price is maybe double compared to a Mr.Greek on a food court somewhere. Walked out of the place without even being acknowledged by the staff while they were talking with each other. We were completely ig I have been on a quest, since moving to Arizona, to find NY Style Pizza. Other places just add "NY Style" to their storefront, but fail to deliver. I tried 1 slice with Xtra cheese and meatballs...and I literally pictured myself walking in NYC eating a slice of NY Pizza. They delivered on their claim and the service was wonderful! Two thumbs way up! Hmmmm. Well we waited forever to get our food. Not sure if it's any good but after an hour wait on a not so busy day, the only activity we saw that was quick was getting our check after we complained about the wait. What a shame.   Doubt I will be back. Service was awful.  Still can't believe the manager allowed us to walk out of there without trying to make amends. I've been in my current house almost 8 years and have had a few issues my ac units. Prior companies gave me the run around and weren't honest or didn't fix my ac's. Found Polar Air through a friend 3 years ago and have been very satisfied since. They have always responded quickly, anytime of the day. Techs were knowledgable, didn't creep my wife out, and I never felt over sold on things. Polar Air is the best ac company I've found in my 15 years of being a homeowner in the Las Vegas valley! The only reason they're getting 3 stars is for the food ...which is GREAT. Unfortunately, Nothing beats quality service.  I visited this establishment at least 3 times a week during my lunch for the convenience and good food, but was always met with such disrespectful tones and demeanor from the wait staff. I have been going here for a while so I will say not all of the employees are bad, but too bad the only pleasant worker is on the grill !! If you're looking for some great hibachi, definitely give this place a try ...just make sure you drop your money, grab your food, and run! I, however, have given them enough my money and will not be returning. I like to get the entire quality experience- food AND service ! The Art of Steel has an eclectic collection of glass, steel, tile, art, knickknacks, and gifts. It's definitely a must-browse store in the Strip District and a great place to buy a gift for that hard-to-buy-for friend or relative. They don't even deserve a single star but their was no other choice.  Stay far away from this unethical company if you can avoid it.    The only reason why I've been forced to stay with them this long is because they are the only business internet service provider in Boulder City, NV.  I'm sorry to say I've been a customer for over 4 years but I'm completely dissatisfied.  They engage in fraudulent bait and switch billing tactics after agreeing to a new two year (lower rate) service agreement, my bill has practically doubled instead of going down each month for three consecutive months now.    Nothing but a sham.  Every time you contact them, you get lost in a quagmire of confusion and disinformation and not to mention the worst customer service I've ever seen.  Some of these people and I'm talking about management are not able to diffuse an escalating issue and only add more fuel to the fire.  The company needs to be rebuilt from the top on down.  Horrible!!! Not well taken care of anymore Bathroom dirty Yogurt stations messy We used to love this place What happened? Does not feel clean Beef plate as well as the chicken were delicious. The soup was amazing with the freshly brewed tea. Loved this place.came here it's friends after dinner and had a fine time bonding over quaint and tasty beverages.liked the service,menu and eccentric furnishings.its all about the experience and we really had a good one.will be coming back soon! I love this place. Always get the chicken kabob which comes with lentil soup or salad. Delicious!!! A little more expensive than jasmine grill across town but a great alternative when on the East side. Don't interpret the gruff nature of the owner as rude just enjoy your delicious meal. My tire was low on my way to work one day so I pulled off the highway and pulled into Big O tires. I already called my job to inform them i was going to be late. As soon as I pulled in, Ray helped me right away, he was extremely attentive and didnt just check the tire that was low, he made sure all tires were good. I dont know if he sensed my urgency, but he was so quick and helpful that I wasnt even late to work ! I've worked with Active Renter since 2011.  I've referred several of my investor clients to Rich.  As a residential realtor, its very important that my clients have a great experince with their investment property, as I rely on them for repeat business (home sales).  Each and every one of my referred clients have been thrilled with the service they receive from Active Renter.  Their fees are typical for the industry, and their customer service is top-notch.  When my clients are ready to sell, Rich refers them back to me for the listing.  He also notifies me of any off-market deals so I can give my investors as opportunity to buy their next rental at a discount.  In addition to referring my investor clients to Active Renter, they also manage my personal rental on 15th Ave and Northern.  They do a phenomenal job. They found me a great tenant, who takes immaculate care of the property.  The home was built in the 1960s, so it has the typical problems you would expect with an older home.  Active Renter does a good job of responding to my tenants maintenance calls while still keeping my repair costs down.  My tenant is ready to renew their lease for a third year, which really helps my cash-flow.  My tenants have even asked if they can purchase the property.  Unfortunately, with a good property manager in place and a great tenant... the property is too profitable of an investment for me to sell. Great atmosphere and the owner was super friendly and funny! I had the butter chicken and it was super delicious. The mango lassi was rich and not too sweet. Definitely would go there again :) My first time tonight - pretty good food. Service lacked BUT Heather saved the night by stepping in and up.   Parm Fries yum. Green Chili Pork - meat needed seasoning but put with the tortilla, squeeze of lime and pico made it tastier. Will be back to try some of the other menu items. Actually called Fresh Buy Market now. Love this place! Best priced produce and Asian supplies in the area. Such friendly staff! SO GOOD. Funghi appetizer, ravioli main (pasta is made fresh daily) + glass of rose+ friends+ friendly service= perfection. Super cute/romantic atmosphere. Come here if you're trying to impress on a first date. Come here if you're like me and enjoy wining and dining with good friends. Coming back. The Rail does a lot of things right. The food is fresh, well-priced, and tasty. The restaurant itself is very nice, with a bar separating the booths and tables from the patio area; this makes access to drinks very convenient. I will say, though, that the service really hits it out of the park!   Happy hour is great and on top of that they also have a specially priced drink all day for particular days of the week. For instance, Long Island Iced Teas are $3 all day on Fridays.   Honestly, the only thing I would change is the a la carte sides...I think it's unAmerican to serve a burger without fries. Keep up the good work Rail, I love ya. I have been using this shop for over 5-years and the customer service does not get any better than Frank's! His prices are the best and he is always fast, I can easily say I do not go anywhere else with my import or domestic truck or cars! Thank you Frank! I had to give them a one star cause there is nothing less then one star.  A group of 9 wanted a nice last meal nothing came even warm to the table after waiting an hour to receive it.  Scallops where not even cooked, baked potatoe was cold, steak was room temperature, and after the reviews we wanted lobster mac and cheese there was no lobster in it at all and we had 3 of them.  Broccoli Raab was a few steamed frozen broccoli crowns that was sent immediate back.  They made 18% gratuity and did a lousy job I'm sitting here writing this as I'm waiting for my check because they are so slow.  Go anywhere but here, especially if you want a nice meal like we did. EDIT: Paul reached out to, and all issues were addressed !! Thanks, Paul !  This review is for the Henderson location. I could have sworn I submitted a review when it happened, but it somehow disappeared. Weird. Anyways, I heard the Vegas location is much better. /shrug  I had two cars repaired here at the same time (vandalism damage). While the actual body work and paint was fine, everything else was a total disaster. One one of the cars, a quarter sized dent in the rear quarter panel seemed to have been caused in the shop. We didn't notice it when we picked up the car at night, so we got screwed right there.  The other car was supposed to be in for a week, and it ended up taking three. They ripped off the front splitter and half-assedly screwed it back on without telling me about it, and I only realized when one of the employees accidentally spilled the beans. After we had to go back to have the replaced window tinted (which took them 3 days !), a big scratch was on the trunk lid. Some sort of white residue was all over the car, and the seal around the window was sticking up in all sorts of places. I should have sued them, but I was tired of the aggravation.  Now somebody rear ended me, and guess what, the insurance company wants to send me there. There's not a snowball's chance in hell I ever have them touch any of my cars again. Parking is a little tricky, but it's totally worth it for this local gem! I'm a traditional sesame and cream cheese kind of girl, but the friendly guy at the counter suggested the pimento BLT on asiago, and I went for it. Hot and melty and crispy and quite possibly this BEST bagel sandwich I have ever had. I want it again tomorrow! Un des meilleurs endroits découvert à ce jour pour savourer un espresso à Toronto. Le service est impeccable, l'endroit est agréable mais surtout, ils sont maitres dans l'art d'être barista. Très agréable endroit où je passe assurément toutes les fois où je visite Toronto. Pinball machines are slowly working their way out of society, so I'm glad a place like this exists. A wonderful and loving tribute to a great past time. Lots of rare, unique, and long forgotten tables that you can play for the 1st or 100th time. There's plenty of famous tables (LOTR, Addams Family, Ripley's) that have had color conversions too. All tables are well cared for and while there's always a handful of tables that are broken they seem to actually fix them. Ample parking and low table prices. $5 or $10 bucks will get you plenty of play time. It's not walkable from the strip, but a cab or Lyft wouldn't be too expensive as you're just to the east. Highly recommended if you have even a passing interest in Pinball. All about Blinds & Shutters....they came, they measured, they installed!! Probably the easiest and most satisfying piece of our recent home update.  A great product for a very reasonable cost. Larry & Corey are the best at what they do. Played an 18-hole round on a Saturday during the mid morning several weeks ago.   The starter got us off on time, so that is always a good thing.  The course as mentioned is previously is 27 holes (three 9 hole courses) along with an Executive course.  We played Red to Blue that day.  The course is fairly wide open but there are some tight holes where a well placed drive will be key.  There are some holes with a few blind shots, but this is not the norm.  There are some water holes and some well placed bunkers.    Overall the course was in really good shape.  Tee boxes and greens were well kept.  There are some burnt out patches on the fairways, but nothing significant.    My only 'gripe' would be a pace of play.  The course is very crowded and yes, I went at the a time where it is even more crowded.  We played in just over 5 hours, which is too long, but there was really no place to go.  There is no beverage cart service either, so it is wise to load up prior to going out or at the turn.  Price was a little expensive, coming in at $55 for 18 and a cart (weekend rates).  Overall, I like coming here, the course is usually in great condition and the employees are always polite and professional. Had an amazing lunch here a while back! The lineup for this food truck usually isn't as long as some of the other ones, and you get your food fairly quickly, which is definitely a plus, since food trucks are generally supposed to be fast. I got the DBL (not the combo) for $8 and it was amazing. The DBL is two pieces of schnitzel with cheese, bacon, sauerkraut all inside. Especially since I'm not the greatest fan of bread or buns, this sandwich/burger was simply perfect. Although the DBL looks small initially, it will fill you up for a nice lunch and the schnitzel is done to perfection - not too oily, but still very crispy and satisfying.   But be prepared though, this isn't a salad or an extremely balanced meal, so if you're looking for some greens, then it might be better to save this for cheat day. All last week, I was sampling different wing places for the best wings. And, I chose wing time! I came in last week and got a little combo just for myself. The combo was just what I wanted, six pieces of wings, with two different flavors. Some blue cheese, french fries, Texas toast. Not to mention, a drink! You get a lot. I did get a little side order of carrots, but it wasn't expensive at all.  Today, we were feeding the wonderful volunteers that are remodeling our church. They are so kind & generous for devoting their free time to our church. So, I placed an order for the 30 wings special. I ordered it ahead of time and it was ready when I got there. Everything was there. And, I really like the way that they separated the cold items and put them in a separate bag.  Everybody loved the wings including myself. I will definitely continue coming here either for the lunch special just for myself or if in the future, there will be another party, I will definitely get their large wings special deal again! I really love their wings! They are perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. Plus, they have the best customer service! The security was awful. My friend was kicked in the back by a group of girls and we were asked to leave. Do not go here. It is all trash. Apparently this is the first review for this company. I can't fathom why others have not reveiwed this company. My 23 year old garage door finally gave up the ghost the other nite. I got quotes from some competitors ranging from 750.00 to 1,100.00 dollars. Both companies came immediately said I needed a new door. I expressed to them by budget was limited and a new door wasn't in that budget. A friend said contact AAA Action Doors. Contacted Josh (part owner)...Told him my budget was limited. He came out took one look at the door,..Said we got this it can be repaired w/o question..All that was needed was new metal bracing along the top and middle. He installed the metal bracing in less than 45 min....I had an operating door again..and saved a bunch of money. This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the quality has dropped precipitously. The food is no longer anything special, and the service can be downright hostile. The last two times we've eaten here, our server (older middle-aged woman wearing way too much perfume) was very rude. Most recently, she made us wait 10 minutes before she came to our table, even though we were the only ones in the restaurant!   She asked if we wanted menus (who asks that question?), then literally fewer than 3 seconds later, asked if we were ready to order. I could feel the animosity radiating from her. We tipped less than 10%, and this still was overly generous. I used to be a waiter, and have only tipped less than 20% in 2 restaurant visits - this is out of probably thousands of visits.   The food is now bland and tastes like fast food Chinese. Even the chicken coconut soup doesn't taste right, and that was their best dish.   It's a damn shame; this used to be one of my favorite restaurants. I'm guessing it was bought by somebody who simply doesn't care, and that attitude is reflected by the staff.   The good ratings here are probably remnants of old visits - I would stay far, far away from this restaurant. An interesting restaurant with a variety of items on the menu. Came here with my dragon boat team for dinner. Quite the busy and huge restaurant located in the Old Montreal. Seems to be quite popular considering the long line outside. Luckily we had a reservation for 52 guests so we had a private room. So for that many people, 2 staff assigned to our group wasn't enough.  For food, I ordered the salmon pizza with arugula. Nice size and quite delicious with a good amount of salmon slices on the pizza. The pizza crust was nicely prepared. For $22, its a little bit on the pricier side but was glad I ordered this tasty dish. For drinks, I ordered a Pina Colada and a beer that's local to Quebec.   Overall, a pretty positive dining experience. Thoroughly enjoyed my food. Staff were friendly and on point with making sure everything was pleasant.t They have quite the extensive menu here which makes it difficult to chose just 1 item here. Highly recommend this place if you happen to be around the old Montreal square. How do they have people being nominated for MVP when: 1) Their team has a losing record? and 2) The same kids do not make the All-Star team? Coaches kids or something??? Came to this Whole Foods in search of hot sauce. In the past, other locations have had a fairly decent selection. This store...not so much. They did have the usual assortment of Cholula and Tobasco, but those can be found anywhere.   We chose a new sauce and one we had previously tried and liked. Then we went in search of cheese. Whole Foods usually has a great selection of cheeses. Well, we didn't find much. This may have been our fault, as we did not walk down every single aisle...just most of them.  We did see sliced cheeses, but not the gourmet ones we hoped to find. We chose a cashew spread that I tried at a friend's place, and got crackers as well.   At the checkout, the cashier had a sign posted saying that she is highly allergic to coconuts, and to please let her know if what you bought has any derivative of coconuts. Well, of the two hot sauces, the rice crackers (in a box), and the cashew spread I felt good in saying 'no coconut here'. She scanned the container and proceeded to look at it from every angle, turning it over and over. She asked where the ingredients were listed. I hadn't looked, so I did not know. She then schooled me on the fact that I would be surprised at how many things contain coconut oil in them. We paid, and went to the car. I was curious, so I found the ingredients. Yep. Contained coconut oil. I left feeling like I lied to her by not telling her it contained this ingredient. Made me uncomfortable. If she is that allergic, maybe gloves would be an option for her. But now I know...I will look at all ingredients if I shop there again, or just not go through her line. WOW!  That's all I have to say.  Not sure what happened since the last time I was here, but it was like going to a completely different restaurant.  Horrible, rude service from BOTH of the waitresses, not just from the one that all the other people here have mentioned--tall, nasty, and always has a look on her face like someone just took a crap in her cereal.  And I sort of got the impression that because I am gaijin (ie: not Japanese) I may have pissed them off even more.  Food still tasted the same (great) but the ambiance and the attitude really, REALLY rubbed me the wrong way.  Needless to say--no tip.  I would have RELISHED the opportunity that the other reviewer had when tall and nasty followed you out to the parking lot and demanded a tip--I guarantee she wouldn't have found that to be a pleasant experience.  You all just lost a customer and a fan--congratulations nasty face!!! Jason recommended the penne shrimp dish its was awesome. Definitely request Jason as your waiter. We will be back Food is Amazing, fresh, yummy. Service is fast and staff is professional and OVER THE TOP ATTENTIVE. Austin, was amazing for Breakfast, wait staff breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert was 1st class!!! ordered a combo burrito, very little chicken, a lot of beans, also come with 8 pieces of chip, for 8 dollar, not worth it at all, i rather go Roberto on Fort apache, much better at anything I've been to the Ajax location and didn't have the best experience. I would still give the Ajax location another try because maybe I just had them on an off day. The butter chicken was not creamy and did not have enough sauce in it at all, chicken was dry.  THIS location on the other hand, the interior was clean, staff were very friendly (not that they werent at the other location) The butter chicken was so delicious! The white meat was well cooked, moist on the inside, the portion of sauce to meat was perfect and the sauce was seasoned with all of the right ingredients making it so creamy.  I also really enjoyed the chicken poutine. It had lots of flavour and im a fan of their fries, crispy and yummy.  I would go back to this location! :) I went here as a group of 6 friends and our waiter, Sonia, was great and very quick to understand how we paired up to split our meals/receipts. I tried poutine here for the first time- Poutine BOM, and my friends ordered Poutine Dynamite, which was a bit more spicier with jalapeños. Both were good! Add a little ketchup on top and it was perfect. The poutine portions were also large enough to split between 2 people. Great Chicago style pizza.  Sat outside to enjoy the weather.  Very attentive server.  Reasonable prices. Je suis allé à quelques reprises aux 3 restos Ottavio et je prends toujours les Linguines Capiccole et poires je n'avais jamais été déçu mais hier sur Marcel Laurin elles étaient ordinaires... Pour le prix 19$ , ont-ils changés la recette? I will, for once, reserve my words:  Get you to this place and check it out yourself!!  'nuff said. I love this place! I started my Bootcamp workout here, 2 weeks ago, and already I lost 8lbs. I bought another weighing scale just to double check, lol!! Well because i can't believe it! I came almost everyday & I love all the coaches! Everyone come here with the same mission & goals, so this really help you to keep motivated! The meals plan for weight loss that my coach gave me really worked & I really felt amazing! I've been coming here for a little over a year now. Great service and friendly staff. The salon is run by Julie and her sister, Tammy, who are both extremely kind and accommodating. They're always willing to squeeze you in, and  even if they're very busy, the wait is never longer than five or ten minutes. Lots of polish colors to choose from (gel and regular). So happy I found this salon and will be coming back for sure! I love chefs Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger, so I was looking forward to experiencing the restaurant during my stay.  The first night we ate at the bar and had a blood orange margarita with a mole rim and the citrus chicken quesadillas.  It was so good I did not want to stop eating, but I was stuffed.  On my last day, we had lunch there, also at the bar.  It was happy hour so the drinks were a little less expensive.  I had the spicy shrimp tacos.  Food, drink and service are phenomenal.  Prices are average; not overly pricy, but not cheap.  You are paying for quality in food and service, so just do it.  Go there.  Eat there. I've always had amazing service, today was nothing short of that free tire rotation and my car ends up dying in the middle of the street in front of their front door. No jumper cables on my end and the gentlemen Marcos and his co worker made sure to help me without hesitation and jump my car. I appreciate you guys so much and all the hard work you all put in day in and day out. Thanks for saving me today!! One of the best pizza places around, and ran by great people!! Always friendly service!! One of the rare treasures of Elyria!! Me and my daughter love this place!! If you haven't tried it you should try the pierogi pizza, it's delicious!!!! I can't believe the service. So kind, patient and reasonable. The food is even better or just as good as the people. I come back time and time again and although it may be slow on busy days, their attitude and kindness blows me away enough that i dont mind being patient myself :) always returning! This resto has "meal of your life" potential! To start, the bread and pesto is to die for. I ordered the half caesar salad, and my loving girlfriend had the half beet salad. Both were nice presentations and incredibly tasty. For main I had the goat cheese tortelli. Will not lie, one of the best meals ever. The duck confit was cooked to perfection. Very tasty and well worth the price. GF had lasagna, and it was just as good as the tortelli. Highly recommend this place...will return! The three guys that they sent out took about two hours to empty my house, and about 1 1/2 to move my stuff into my new house.  Very professional the entire time, personable, and they took impeccable care of my stuff, nothing was damaged, they wrapped each piece of furniture with pads or plastic.  Under $800 for the move, and it was so great to not have to do it myself. I would recommend them to anyone. I've been buying my tires for all my vehicles from Discount Tire for years... I'm always pleased with the products, service, and customer support.   Anyone that is in need of tires I wouldn't go anywhere else. This is such a fun addition to University circle.  I've been here twice; both times to watch football games.  There are at least twenty widescreen tvs here.  Its two stories with bars and bowling lanes on each floor.  They take reservations and have valet  parking.  Both times I got the chicken tenders.  I wouldn't come here specifically for the food but rather for the "activity dining" atmosphere.  Bowling for walk ins is 35$ per hr but 50$ per hr for reservations.  The shoe rental is 3$.  The entrees are 10 to 20$ and mixed drinks around 8 to 10$.  This is my go to place to watch big games.  Bowling here with a group friends will always make for an enjoyable event. I waited almost an hour past my appointment (I called in to book ahead) with no apology or explanation. I've also had these nails (extensions) for a week now and decided they're a bit too long to be functional - called in to ask if they could shorten it and was told it would be $10! Will likely not come back because the customer service is seriously lacking and they seem to want to charge you for every bloody little thing. Even their prices aren't so cheap that I can overlook everything else. Not a 5 Star hotel, but still worth checking out. You can't beat the location either.... The best pizza in Las Vegas. The people working there are nice and polite. Love the place. Very clean place too. Love this place. Good vibe. Friendly staff. Great music. $5.50 pints.  Will definitely come back! So far so good...19.99 gets  you and a guest in. The staff is nice and friendly. This place is way cleaner then the other gyms in the area. Only downside is that this place gets hot . seems to be a crap ac or something.. But overall the experience is pretty okay...  Tip place gets super packed from 5~9 The crepe is a must try at this store. The drink is quite sweet, including both cold and hot drinks. The desserts in the cooler are terrible, looks nice for Instagram pic though. The owners of this restaurant have another location in Charlotte that has been open a very long time, and I can't, for the life of me, figure out why! My husband and I LOVE a good deli and were so excited to see this place so close to home. The excitement wore off about 5 minutes into the visit. Service was okay, but felt like I had to order and get out in record time. I ordered a Ruben and my husband ordered a corned beef sandwich. They should be ashamed of themselves with the quality of bread and corned beef that they serve. The cole slaw and potato salad tasted like they bought it packaged from Walmart or Sam's Club. There is nothing special about this place and I can make a better corned beef brisket at home, which isn't saying much. Skip this place. Sadly we still have to wait to get a good New York deli in Charlotte and surrounding. The donuts here were amazing.  This is the donut shop formerly known as Presti's.  I won't explain in detail just how good they are because it would just be mean since they are now closed.  I just drove by and called them.  There is no more Gillys.  sniff... Pleasant surprise to find a Quiznos open, even better when I actually had the sandwich. Tasted great.  It's a shame there aren't more Quiznos like this one. Awesome truck...can't wait for brick and mortar location to open.  The Nash-Vegas Hit Chicken is the best in the West Coast!!!  House pimento is amazing! My husband and I stopped in to Guitar Center on a Saturday afternoon in search of a keyboard. I'm a vocalist, but I needed something simple and affordable to help me in my practicing.   When we arrived I saw it was quite busy inside. Employees were very busy running around everywhere to help different customers. I was actually a little happy about this because I didn't want to be pressured by someone into buying a fancier keyboard than I needed. We were able to browse the selection, try different options, and decide on our own. After making our choice I tracked down an employee at the front desk (Tyler) who came and helped us right away. He asked if we need a power source, and I'm thankful he did, because that's something I didn't think about. He tracked down what we needed and checked us out. He asked if we wanted a warranty, and he was able to answer all my questions about it without pressuring me.   Tyler was super helpful, professional, and efficient, and I'm thankful he was the one to help us. We were very satisfied with our experience and will definitely be back to this location for our future music needs! I've shopped at a half-dozen or so Neighborhood Markets. This is Walmart's Supermarket concept. That means that it's about groceries and dairy and frozen and meats, plus a section for personal care. The store doesn't have a Tire & Lube or a Vision and not much for electronics and zero for housewares and clothing. Just food.  And as Neighborhood Markets go, this one was pretty good. The shelves were stocked, the store was tidy on a Sunday morning and the associates who I encountered knew the "Ten Foot Rule."  It was a good shop. I was very impressed by this optometrist. I was in and out in less than 30 minutes, paperwork, exam, and ordering contacts. Really liked their new system where you don't have to say "1 or 2" a bunch of times... very efficient. Dr. Beal was also really nice and talked me through everything he was doing which I appreciated. Definitely one of the best optometry experiences I've had! I will preface this review by saying that I have been a long time Aveda customer. I've never had a bad experience in an Aveda salon. That said, some experiences stand out more than others. Recently moving to Las Vegas from Denver, I was nervous about finding a new stylist. I was loyal to my Aveda stylist in Denver for over 5 years and loved every cut, color, and experiment. Today I took the plunge and scheduled a haircut as I desperately needed about a foot of hair chopped. I met Jessica, and she immediately put me at ease. She listened to my stories of how my hair has changed over the course of a pregnancy, she understood my challenges as a busy mom, and she wisely offered advice on some face framing and bang maintenance. She was funny, smart and personable. And that's just the beginning of Jessica's amazing work. After relieving me from about 4 pounds of hair, Jessica so beautifully framed my face and shaped my hair to a magnificent style. Please don't miss this salon. From the massaging shampoo chairs to the fabulous stylists, they will leave you looking your best. Your account gets put on auto renew. Then you get charged the first payment of next year before you are allowed to cancel with a zero balance. Then you can't get a refund for the payment even though you haven't used the services.   Literally they took 40 bucks for NOTHING.  The people on the phone were really rude about it too. Probably because they hear it all day. Sadly the service was pretty good, but I can't abide taking your money and giving nothing in return. I was looking for a change and an update from my straight boring hair. Alis did her magic and created a custom shag cut that looks amazing flat ironed or curled with beach waves. Oh by the way the shampoo and scalp massage is to die for! She is worth the spend the girls got skills! I'm torn on how to review this one.  The pros: The ambiance and decor are super cute. Like a dressed up farmhouse.  The food is good and very "farm to table" (that's so hot right now).  Good selection of cocktails.  Nice patio.  Open for lunch.   Cons: The prices are pretty high. For food that includes sandwiches and salads, you are paying in the teens for each dish. Drinks are equally expensive.  Service is hit and miss (from my 3 visits). They're friendly and all, but sometimes just seem to forget about things like clearing dishes or refilling drinks.   Bottom line: it's a cool place with good food, but I won't go again unless somebody else requests it. So I needed a beer and had never been to Tyber Creek.  Not sure what's kept me from going, maybe I think I had the feeling it was a little neighborhood joint and it's not IN my neighborhood or something.    Either way, this is a pretty cool, sort of outdated, friendly bar.  Irish bar with plenty of great and cold beers on tap as well as an appetizer and bar menu that can compete with the best of them.  Friendly bartenders keep the drinks coming and it's not hard to tell why people like this place.  It is definitely a come as you are kind of place and I like that. Love this place! Very high quality, if not pricey food. The reason for this 5 star review is for their happy hour. The prime burger is one of my favorite burgers in town & during happy hour it's only $7 for this quality bacon burger. You get your choice of cheese ( I get blue) & a side of fries. If your a burger lover check out one of the best deals in Vegas. I could not have asked for more than AHR Mechanical provided:  Promptness, honesty and value.  Our AC went out on a Sunday.  I called Mike and a technician (Darold)  was at my house in one hour.  Darold was friendly and only sold me what I needed to get the AC running again.  He even commented that he was surprised to see a 12-year-old AC unit running as smoothly as it was!  Clearly, he was not going to try to upsell me like many other companies have.  Darold worked quietly and had the AC working in under 30 minutes.  While the cost of AC repair is ubiquitously exorbitant, AHR offered many discounts.  They also offered a one year warranty on the part they replaced.  I would confidently call them for any other AC repairs we may need and I'd recommend you do the same. Red Robin is hopping on a Friday night...service was great. Go Matt!  Attentive, friendly, and efficient. Our burgers were delicious and those fries are the best.  I had the DGB ...I heard music with the first bite.  What a wonderful combination of favors.  My son had the Royal burger and the egg was beautiful.  He complained that the bacon tasted like microwave bacon....but managed to eat every bite.  Red Robin....hummmmmm I would give them a zero if I could. They talked me into other services, my fault for being naive and trusting. He was a fast talker, and as soon as I agreed to those other services, they packed up and left. Didn't even do the work. Very shady and I DO NOT RECOMMEND. Professional, honest, fair pricing, and dependable.  I don't know about the rest of the yelp viewers out there but these are the most important traits I look for when doing business.  Carpet Monkey of Las Vegas delivered all of them in spades ( pardon the play on Las Vegas and spades   ). They were prompt and extremely professional, the owner was incredibly concerned with whether or whether not I was happy with his service. Just for the record I was extremely pleased. I am almost embarrassed to say what a difference they made on my tiles.  Night and day.  I've been in my house for 10 years regularly have it cleaned however I've never had my tiles steamed and chemically cleaned like they performed and what a difference, I'm so happy.   I just happen to find them via reading some reviews on yelp and thought that I'd give them a shot I am so glad I found them.  So if you're riding the fence on whether or whether not to give him a shot all I can say is I would pull the trigger and call them again in a heartbeat.  They will be my only go to carpet and tile guys from now on. This place is always chaotic.  Super super super busy, but that's because it's really fun!  As a girl, I know a lot of girls wouldn't be comfortable or have fun golfing at a "driving range," but that's why Top Golf is so great, because even if you don't want to play, you can just hangout and eat/drink with your friends who are playing.  Whether you're coming here for a date, birthday party, in a big group, or whatever it may be, this place is great for people of all ages.  The atmosphere itself is really fun and it's just a super cool idea that's entertaining. I have been eating warm pies on location and buying frozen pies to eat at home ever since the first location opened.   I am a huge fan of their savoury pies! I honestly cannot pick a favourite because I like so many of their pies and decide on the flavour based on what I'm craving at the time. I enjoy the braised beef rib, beef 'n beer, butter chicken (slightly spicy), veg-ilicious, pulled pork. The seasonal flavours are great too!  I'd love to try the lobster shrimp, but it's been sold out whenever I visit.  As for the sweet pies, the cheesecake with raspberry is my fave!   I also enjoy the coleslaw. The dressing is tart and the perfect amount. The dried apricot adds a great texture and sweetness. I just wish the cabbage was chopped more finely. The carrots are julienned, yet the cabbage is chopped in large pieces, which makes for a tough texture. Amazing Steak and Cheese... Better than any Philly one I have ever had... Takes a little while tom order and get your food but that's cause it's so good!! Great pizza too! Terrible and expensive experience both times. First one was a year ago, when I requested the parts fellow to order me a new muffler. He said it would be in, in about 3 days. 5 days later I called, and he forgot to order it. 10 days later, I called them again, and they still forgot to order it, despite me being in front of the counter.  Second situation was on Nov. 4 th, 2017. My 1998 Rav 4 was not carrying a charge despite me purchasing a new battery, the evening before. On that cold and snowy day, my wife and I broke down on 130th Ave S.E. . I managed to get the vehicle as far as the Safeway Parking lot, where we were stranded. I called the Canadian tire across the street and spoke to the manager. He told me to bring it right in. Well, we called a tow truck and waited for 2 and a half hours. No biggy there as it was a busy day for them as one could imagine. We brought the vehicle in on a large flat bead truck. I asked the mechanic, where did he want it; and he said anywhere. Once we dropped it; I went inside and spoke to Ron about the problems. Ron was a super nice guy. Very friendly. I mentioned to him, that there was a loose + positive cable clamp that had to be tightened. I needed to have the alternator checked as the new battery died on us . "After the repairs are completed Ron, could you please have them do a safety check on the vehicle please?" Here came the upsell. " Well, he said, we have 3 different types of safety checks. Then he felt a pressing need to tell me all about them and their respective prices. I cut him off short, and instructed him to provide me with the cheapest (100.00) safety check.  Here in point form, were the blunders that were committed.  1. Ron got my name wrong, my sex wrong, and all this with me standing in front of him and correcting him as he put an entirely different name on the key tag. I corrected him and even called back to ensure that the information on the work order was complete; but he didn't even bother to put down the much needed information. That's just plain unprofessional.  2. I spoke to him about purchasing a new battery, just the night before, and that my + cable clamp was not tight. Despite this, he didn't bother to put any of this on the work order.  3. Never informed me of the labor costs, part costs if it was a alternator and so forth 4.Never mentioned on the work order that the vehicle died while driving; but instead, said that it just stalled.  5. The assistant manager " Dennis" called and left a message for me, that the Rav would not pass a safety test because that battery is not working, and a headlight bulb was out. (Well of course....why do you think it was there?)  6. The assistant manager called me a second time at my residence later the next day; and informed me that my alternator would need replacing despite it being purchased new from one year previous. I asked him how much the alternator was and he gave me a rough cost. Then he said I would be charged. 1.2 ( which I guess was one hour and twenty minutes) for the labour. Fair enough I said, go ahead with the repair. At this point I figured;, it will be about 5 hundred dollars by the time they soak me for everything.  7. Later that day I picked up the vehicle and it was way over and above at $683.00. When asked to explain the costs...they said they were too busy.  8. When I arrived home, I looked at the invoice and noticed that they hadn't even taken the time to fill out the top of the safety check. Truth be known, they never probably checked a thing. No name, no policy number, no make model or year of the vehicle, no Vin number, no date...absolutely nothing! 9. Shop supplies was 35 dollars and some change. There are only two bolts that secure an alternator to it's bracket. Tell me where were there 35 worth there?  10. The assistant manager couldn't provide me ( their customer) with the proper warrantee period for it, nor did he know how long safety checks are good for.  ** Now after all that, does this sound like a professional service to you? They should be ashamed for treating customer's this way.  Needless to say; I won't be back for any service. They are reckless and unprofessional. Great fresh burgers. I had cheese burger with fried egg side of chili onion rings. Price kind of high. Original LA is much better. I spent 45 minutes in this store shopping for my babies and our home.  Got to the check out counter and unloaded my order.  The cashier started checking me out and then called another cashier over and she told me Target stores were on probation and could no longer take WIC.  There is not one sign posted anywhere to this in the store or on the front window of the store.  The isles still have the WIC symbols on them.  The cashier said she could call the front manager and I told her what good was it going to do if they don't take WIC.  I left a full cart with her and told her I had to go elsewhere now.  When I got home I called the corporate office and put in a complaint.  The person I spoke with had no knowledge of this but took my name and said he was going to look into the matter and advised me to call the manager at the store. I called the manager at the store and the only thing he could be bothered to tell me was they used to take WIC but don't any longer.  I told him there were no signs posted to that and that the shelves still had the WIC stickers on them.  His answer to me was that there was no sign on the front window saying they took WIC.  I also told him I spoke with some employees regarding something I was looking for and they saw the WIC checks in my hand and never said anything. This store is taking up space.  I have gone there numerous times on a Sunday for milk and eggs only to find they were totally out of whole milk and eggs.  Please who is doing the ordering.  I will continue to shop at Walmart even though this store is only a mile away from me.  The manager never even said he was sorry, only had excuses, I hung up. Well, it was not amazing. There are better places in Charlotte to get sushi. And we were over charged for our drinks! Aside that, the service was great and the place is nice. Would I go back? Likely no. I go to this market some time. The good thing is that they open until 12 am so I can stop by this place late night. The bad thing is that those hispanic workers are very unprofessional.  I do speak Spanish and understand what they are saying in Spanish inside the store. My experience today was the worst... Three of Mexican workers were using nasty cursing words in front of the customers assuming that no one understood what they were saying, such as "puta(Bitch or whore)' or "chingado(F--- u)." Those are extremely nasty & disrespectful cursing words and I was totally grossed out. I told them that they shouldn't use those nasty words in front of the customers then one of them joked, "Puta means pretty in Korean." Of course not.. That really insults Koreans and their culture. I was totally disappointed in their unprofessional act and attitude and would like to stay away from this store for a while. It doesn't matter what language they speak, but they should NEVER use disrespectful cursing words in front of the customers. End of the line. This place is an excellent place to go if you are in or around the Strip.  The food is delicious, prices are good, and staff is friendly.  Although i have only had the chicken, you cannot go wrong with it.  I have had the 1/2 chicken and also the crispy chicken burrito and both were very good.  In addition, I always get the yucca fries; my lunch order is now a burrito with yucca fries and all for under $10 and i can't finish it all.  In addition, always get the green sauce and use it to your heat tolerance.  It definitely has a kick to it, so mix it with some mayo especially for the yucca fries.  I don't know if I would drive out of my way to eat here, but it is worth going if you are close. I've been going to Touch of Life for a few months now.  James is an excellent massage therapist. Ask about their specials when you make an appointment. They offer pretty good package deals. TOTALLY GAUDY BUT GREAT! Spent my 26th birthday wknd here.  It also happened to be my first trip to Vegas, despite living in LA since I was 18--imagine that!  Anyhow, we stayed in suite with a step down living room and all the gold in that place made me wear my stunna shades--LOL!!!  Definitely check out the V-Bar.  The drinks are unique and this place is definitely for the 'grown and sexy'. This location in the forum shops is wonderful! The staff is really nice and helpful! I would choose this location over the Fashion Show Mall because the staff there are very snooty and rude!  Tiffany & co focuses on Superior customer services and the Forum Shops location really showcases this! Great Job! I have been going to Dental Care West, the west side clinic offered by A.T. Still University since April 2015. They came highly recommended.    I have had my scheduled appointments change 3 times without my approval. I find out about the change when I show up for my originally schedule appointment. This is very bad customer service.  Otherwise, most of the residents are OK dentists. You have to have a new dentist every July, so I am up to my third 'regular" dentist. To get my appointments when I needed them, I changed the resident & dentist. I found out that many of the residents and their coaching dentists don't read the files to know what is going on with my treatment before I come in. This bad practice. I also had a problem when the dentist did work he thought I needed without discussing it with me first but not owning up to it after I got angry. Frustrating.  I have to go back hopefully only 1 more time to fix the problem they created. Problem: I had root canals and crowns done and then they did the implant extraction. During the healing time, my prior crowned teeth shifted resulting in a large gap between my teeth and pain.  They do realize that this is a problem they caused and are not charging me but they keep putting off doing the work. So now I'm re-scheduled with a different resident/dentist so I can get my work done.  The support staff that help the dentists are the best. Front office -not so much. It's been a long drawn out process.  I just want my teeth fixed. It shouldn't be this difficult. This place is a hidden gem! We moved to Vegas from San Francisco last year and have been here several times since. I took some friends here last weekend, that were visiting and they fell in love with it too. The play yard in the back is a blast!! So much fun!! Drinks are super affordable. We had an adorable waitress named Anne Marie and she was awesome! Super nice, quick with our drinks, very attentive and personable. I've been a server before so I'm a bit picky but she was on it! Love this place! Dr Vicuna is fabulous! She was very thorough and didn't mind me asking a million questions. Lol She is very patient. New club in the Hard Rock, and currently the hottest place in Vegas... Similar to Rain.  Best club on Sunday night, hands down. if i could give a 0 star i would...  so my husband and i decided to try the Clicklist function of order online and pick up groceries curbside. we arrived at 7:01 pm and watched for well over 10 minutes through the glass at the associate that was manning the station took cell phone calls, cut paper with scissors, took a selfie and what not before my husband went into the store proper to ask about getting our order. well after a minute after returning to the car after talking to customer service we decided to film said associate. she took another call and what not and we have well over 4 minutes of footage of her doing nothing. at this point we hit the 20 minute mark of waiting and my husband went back into the store where he was met by the cs employee and the manager. they called the associate up and she admired she'd taken some calls and told us we should have called her to let her know we were there. the websites specifically states to stay in your car as they come out to you and no phone number or instructions to call are issued in the confirming email i received. the manager didn't even apologize for her employee or try to make amends just assured my husband our card hadn't been charged as of yet so we canceled the order. we went to the smiths on sahara and nellis our normal store which doesn't have the Clicklist feature. i told them what happened and they gave us the office number to the area and we will be calling them as well as submitting screen shots of my confirming email, my order confirmation number and the 4 plus minutes of video to their corporate email.   good luck explaining the cell phone usage. Went here looking for gluten free fried chicken and found my new favorite place to eat! I hate going to the strip but for chicken like my granny used to make....I make an exception! It has best country-chic atmosphere and the manager is legit one of the nicest dudes you'll meet! Bar menu rocks too! Will he back again as!soon as we can. You rock Yardbird! Horrible service and communication. Owner was very rude and lacked professionalism even after acknowledging a mistake on his website that lead me to believe I could get a hand wash at 4:45 pm when hours of operation 8:00am -7:00pm. I drove 30 minutes and he didn't seem to care and instead walked away leaving an argumentative employee behind. Too many options in Charlotte to give this place my business. In-N-Out is ok.  That's it, ok. I truly think most people go because they think it's a cool thing to do. Carl's Jr. burger,(the Big Carl) is a far better burger. Food is good but they dont let you mix match like bdubs ... So for that u get two stars bruh Came here to meet my BFF, we had happy hour.  Everything was great, food, drinks, price, and service!  I love this place and the atmosphere. Let me start with positives. I've never had a bad (weak) drink at Kelly's, and I feel it's very reasonably priced. The only food I've tried was the mac and cheese, which was ok given how much it cost.  Kelly's has two major issues: cleanliness and service. The booths are covered in crumbs, regardless of the time of night, and the tables often need wiping. Mysterious sticky stains abound.  The service would be so-so if not for this crazy policy: let's say you sit at a table. No waiter has been paying attention to you, so you go to the bar to get a drink. Are you allowed to bring that drink back to your table? No, you have to drink it at the bar! It's a kind of catch-22.  For these reasons, I have to give a 2 star rating - there are better bars around. I have NEVER had a bad meal there! Larissa has always been my server and she rocks! The salmon is great but she's the real draw! Great service makes a place! Holy smokes! This place is one time consuming portal of gimmicks and awful service. First, the service is not great and the overall experience is way too pricy. Now, never mind that the overpriced single dish indian entrees are mediocre at best ... for some reason a sword wielding candle balancing bellydancer is supposed to make for a good experience?   It was loud as hell inside, and then the bellydancing made any conversation entirely inaudible to the point where i had to ask my 'server' what he said numerous times. Now aside from letting children play with a massive sword by other guests, balancing candles on her head, and harassing patrons to get up and dance with her, the bellydancing was not only dangerous but unnecessarily noisy.  The food itself? Meh. Ive been to many indian places, this is the least impressive. But hey, we got to wait an extra hour before paying a $60 bill for 2 people. I can't remember when I had a lunch as good as today's ....wait.....the last time was when I was here last ....about 9 months ago. This place ROCKS!!   Ravi is awesome. I used to pick up lunch here weekly then sadly moved jobs and I  wasn't around the corner any longer.  If your lucky enough to be in the neighbourhood - do not turn down the opportunity to stop in and grab a bite to eat.   There are always daily specials and the menu is posted on the large blackboard as you walk in. There are only 4 or 5 types of wraps and they are all great !    If you get here just before noon you beat the rush, even if you get caught in the line - it's well worth the wait.  Every single item on the menu is terrific !    Today I brought a friend here for a quick lunch and we both had the combo of corn & crab soup and the lamb wrap !! ..........WOW was it fantastic !   The combo is a prefect lunch.   The restaurant is small and seats about 16 at a very large communal table and there are about 4 additional tables in the back space, or if you prefer to sit facing the street, you could be lucky to grab a spot at the window.    In the spring, summer and early fall the patio is open and it is a lovely space to have lunch.   Thanks Ravi - you and your team do a great job and I hope to return soon. Love it here. Scallops and Sea Bass are delicious. It's comfortable, a little pricey, but worth the meal. I'm updating my review.... yet again.  I've come back to this place, since it's like 2 min from my house  The sushi fish was better.  Average.  Edible.  Good for a quick fix.  Solid 3 stars. We heard that they were preparing Pho.....it was delicious!  The crispy Vietnamese egg rolls were a nice compliment! I purchased a used safe on Craigslist.  Not just any safe mind you.  Oh no, I HAD to have the super high security 4000 lb bank safe ... especially at the dirt cheap price it was listed.  Let me say that again - FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS.  Two tons.  About the same as a Toyota Highlander.  5 feet tall, 4 feet wide, and about 35 inches deep.  I spent several days calling around to places to get it moved.  No one wanted to touch this thing.  Then I called The Safe Keeper.  Don (the owner) agreed to do it for $800.  More than I wanted to spend, because I'm a cheapskate.  I finally agreed since no one else would take the job.  I'M GLAD I DID!!  Don and 3 of his guys picked it up from a warehouse near the strip, moved it to my home in Centennial.  They used two pallet jacks, an assortment of wood blocks and chocks, and floor coverings.  Four turns and one 36 inch wide doorway later, they had it placed EXACTLY where I wanted it.  No scuffed walls.  No indentations in the linoleum.  No damage to persons or property whatsoever.    Not a lot impresses me.  (See my other reviews.)  But these guys did.  Folks, the whole crew were professional safe movers who worked seamlessly together.  FIVE STARS.  ALL THE WAY.  CALL THEM WHEN YOU NEED A SAFE MOVED. The Venetian straddles the dual-aspect of early 21st Century Las Vegas very well.  It's got the appeal of calculated imitation that is the Adult Disneyworld but still has the polish of the Unrestrained Opulence that Las Vegas is evolving to--sort of Dubai with gambling.  The crowd here is very diverse, with wealthy foreign tourists both as guests and herded through the shopping mall under the auspices of paid tour guides. Certainly it's a monument to global ambition.  Indeed, Vegas is evolving, and I can imagine that when it opened the Venetian was the pinnacle of elegance on the strip.  While no longer at the summit, it still is a fantastic place to stay at.  The rooms are decorated in classic Italian motif, and are fairly spacious.  Some of the aspects of the room were showing their age (we did need to call maintenance at one point).    The property is indeed huge, with a lot to offer--top notch dining, upscale shopping, and considerable entertainment (Venetian troubadors, gondola rides, shows, casinos).  The scale of the operation can be put into perspective by recounting my check-in experience.  I felt like I was boarding a cruise ship with the crowds, the processing, the walk to the cabin--all excellently done, but if that's not what you are looking for in a vacation you may need to re-think the Vegas thing.  We went off-peak (during the week) and felt the room rates were a good deal.  If I ever go back to Vegas, I'll consider staying again. Food is awesome! Been eating there since 2000. Pizza is good but I love the sandwiches. Chill vibe I wanted to like this salon- it seemed cute and trendy.. I had just had a baby and was really looking forward to a fresh new haircut.  Unfortunately my experience was disappointing.  The front desk attendant offered the person who came in about 10 minutes after me a cup of tea, but failed to offer me any tea until that point when he realized he had forgotten to ask me if I wanted tea as well.  As soon as he brought the tea to me my stylist was ready so I didn't get an opportunity to drink it.  I showed my stylist pictures of what I wanted and explained in detail what I did and did not want.  She said she could do it and proceeded to cut my hair without conversing with me at all the whole time.  As a disclaimer I have curly/wavy hair.  I asked for side swept bangs that blended into my layers. The stylist insisted on blowing my hair out straight when she was finished-including a full fringe of blunt cut bangs on my forehead.  When I got home and examined my hair I saw all the layers were uneven and there was no way to style the bangs except to pull them back with bobby pins.    I now go to another salon and the person who cuts my hair does so for less than this salon charged- and it looks great every time...  I was really disappointed because its seems like other people had good experiences at this salon. Snakes and Lattes has great customer service, this is a really important yet often overlooked aspect of any business. They are prompt in replies to emails and try to be as flexible as they can be. I made a reservation two months prior for June 22nd and at the last minute had to change it. They couldn't guarantee I'd get a table, but lo and behold everything worked out. I love that they text you to let you know your table is ready - I really hate getting phone calls.  Food prices are expensive, but with a $5 cover and no time limit I'd be happy to pay their prices. Everyone was really great, even when I was just popping in to buy a game. I love it here and will definitely be back with more people in tow.  Oh and the strawberry cheesecake milkshake is SO DELICIOUS.  My only criticism is they really need to get proper tables for the couch area. It's hard to play a non-board game like Carcassonne the City on tables with slats. Love this place! Have my nails and daughter's nails done here. Friendly staff, clean and always a great job. Kathy and Veena great jobs. They are busy but I don't mind waiting. Have tried most nail shops around here. This one is my fav! Best fried chicken ever!!! The issue I persistently have with chicken is that it is not usually well seasoned. But the chicken at this place was wonderfully well seasoned. I mean even the bits closest to the bone are just as well seasoned as the surface meat. So every bite was absolutely delicious! It was very tender and moist  and not overly greasy. I come from the South and I have not had better fried chicken!  I ordered their Blue plate. I was doubtful about spiced watermelon with chicken. (I mean watermelon on a main dish with chicken?!?). But once I had it, it totally made sense! The sweetness and juiciness of watermelon goes delightfully with the fried chicken; it kinda acts as a palette cleanser and takes away any feeling of greasiness. Totally yum! Honestly, I think I'd always try fried chicken with watermelon after this. Don't be put off by this unusual combo! The spiced watermelon isn't overly spiced. I tasted salt, pepper and cilantro. It's very refreshing.  Only issue: portion sizes are little small compared to the usual American size portions. But it was a treat! Fried Rice - Tasteless, Tasteless Chicken Wings - Dry, Dry Pot Stickers - Doughy, Doughy Yummy, Yummy - Isn't, Isn't Horribly over priced! The selection was such a shame, very few dessert to choose from. Service was slow and not very friendly, It was are first time at the MGM how were we supposed to know !  will not be returning When there again. Figure I give it another shot.well nope same thing happened again another order of burnt toast. I love Denny's I honestly think they are better than IHOP. I'm going to have to find another one to go to. After having issues with nearby Terrible Herbst. Trying to use Gift Cards, I received . Went to this one. Was in and out with no issues. Thanks Sarra. Worth leaving one of the Gift Cards at other store. Been there several times and every one has been a phenomenal dining experience. Very unique; I urge people to go at least once to experience a great restaurant with an old Vegas feel. Amazing ice cream parlour!!!! We were staying at an air bnb nearby, and opted to treat myself to a cone before I head home. Man, was the ice cream CREAMY. Though, the cone is not the best quality, the ice cream itself trumphs most places I've had. Get it in a cup if it satisfy you. Bottom line: TRY IT, you won't be disappointed. Wish I discovered it earlier. would've had a cone everyday!!!! If you enjoy luxuries like electricity and running water, keep looking because you won't find it here. I can't tell you how many days the electric or water has been shut off for hours at a time. If you are looking for a place that will make your home susceptible to robbery, this is the place for you!. A few weeks ago they hired painters to come around and paint all the doors. The painters came in the morning while I was at work and left my door open to let the paint dry while I wasn't home. I came home around 5:30 PM to find the door to my apartment completely wide open. Thankfully nothing was stolen or vandalized but this just goes to show you how inept this complex  and its managers are at running a safe and responsible business. I reported the incident to management and never received any kind of response. My unattended apartment was left wide open for 8+ hours and the management couldn't be bothered to even call or email me about the situation.   To top it off, last weekend I had to call 911 because a half-naked meth addict was trying to break into my car because she "needed a place to sleep". 3 cops, a firetruck and an ambulance ended up having to come to deal with the woman. This is the 3rd time in 5 months I have had to call 911 for drug addicts in the parking lot of this complex.   Living here isn't only a horrific experience, it's dangerous. Do. Not. Live. Here.   Because living here has been a complete nightmare, I am moving out a month early. It's not worth living somewhere as dangerous as this.  P.S. -- all the 5 star reviews for this place are written by the employees. Since hiring a new gm this place has been worth coming to they make the ice cream like they used to I would highly recommend this location.... We are two of many many regulars at Rainbow donuts. Good stuff!! Fresh delicious pastries (they are creative as well) and freshly made breakfast items. We usually get breakfast burritos and they are yum! Fast and delish, always solid service too! If I could give zero stars I would. My friend and I came 1/1/17 at 2:15pm (they opened at 2pm) when we arrived the hostess told us it would be a 30-40 minute wait for food because they were busy. We decided that we would stay bc the restaurant was small & the crowd wasn't very large; big mistake. After we were seated it took 10 minutes for our waitress to come over to the table for our drink orders. Then another 20 minutes for her to bring our drinks & take our order. After over an hour my friend was brought her meal; whiting & super cold grits. The waitress said they were putting my wings in now for my chicken & waffles; after over an hour. My friend asked for new grits and after ten minutes she still hadn't received new grits and my food had not come. It was now 4pm & I was over it. We had the waitress cancel our orders. During this extremely long wait for food (of which mine never came) our waitress not once checked on our table. The person next to us canceled his check after waiting so long for food. After paying for my mimosa (given to me in a red wine glass) the waitress did offer my friend and I an expired coupon for 10% off our next visit. I'll pass. I went to Chirofit after a car accident, and it was the best thing that I could have done. Dr. Stamp was awesome and really got my body back into shape... please forgive the pun. The office staff is very nice and is really on top of things. I'd definitely recommend the Peoria, AZ location!  The ONLY thing I was a little worried about (and not enough to take a star away) was that they are attached to a Gold's Gym. Never ONCE was I approached or pressured to join the gym. I was quite worried that I would have a difficult time getting to Madison from Milwaukee. However my host who I decided to stay with to fulfill a promise I made to him if I ever made it out to Wisconsin suggested I try Badger Bus to get to Madison (he could have told me about Badger Bus while I was still in DC, but I digress...) Anyhow, I ordered the tickets online ($40 round trip), went to Milwaukee Intermodal Station, gave the driver my name, and got on the comfortable bus! If I was going to rate, I was going to rate 4 for lack of outlets for charging. However, the very friendly bus driver announced that the outlets were on the floor near my ankles...sure enough the were. I am from "back east" where they are usually under the windows, but I was happy they had them so 5 stars! There is free WiFi as well but I have unlimited data, so I am good. I would definitely use this again and highly recommend if you a traveling to and from Milwaukee/Madison. This is not the fastest branch, but it is the branch that several employees know me from me coming in often. They are personable here and really take time to make sure you are taken care of. Although I have been going to DeFalco's for years, my last visit was a waste. Two orders of side salads were not included in my take out order. So I returned and received them. Only to return home and find out my 4 orders of meatball subs were not even correct. How do you get meatball subs mixed up? SMH. Not worth the drive since I'm coming from Mesa for what use to be friendly and exceptional service and correct orders of what I order. Fast and efficient downtown Calgary Starbucks.  Was impressed with the baristas ability to keep up with large orders, all correct and quick.  Great Job! If you're at the mall it's great. If you need to go for repair, it's a bit of a hassle to park and walk to this location next to JC Penny.  A screw broke in my glass frames. My sister strong recommend I go here. She said they will fix it and not charge you. She was right. If i was local, this would be the place I would go. I got a prenatal massage during my stay at Omni and it was so nice and lovely. I felt very relaxed and it was much needed. Was able to enjoy a few more hours after the massage lounging in the spa pool and enjoyed a lovely lunch with my husband overlooking the mountains. Went there for late breakfast. Place was small but very clean. Choice was limited to Taiwanese style crepe rolls and Malaysian style breakfast. I had the chicken curry with roti chanai which was very tasty and portion was large and price was excellent compared to other Malaysian restaurants I have  been to. We also had the signature breakfast sandwich that was very tasty and prepared fresh. Hong Kong style milk tea was also good. If they could have froth up the milk ,it would have been a great cup of Teh Tarik. I think there is room for satay on their menu since they already use charcoal grill for their toasts. It is a good place for a quick bite for sure. Good service great food at a very reasonable price. I hope to return to sample the bah kut teh among other foods. The worst place to get your nails done. Rude and obnoxious. 45$ for a pedi and thy forgot the praffin wax at the end. THATS THE WHOLE POINT OF A 45$ pedi. This Rubio's is located within the Monte Carlo Resort & Hotel in the food court. The prices are a little steeper because of this but that doesn't stop me from eating here. The customer service I receive is always friendly, they have a smile on their face and for the number of customers they are serving during the lunch rush, the food comes out quick.  Their burritos are my favorite. I love their tortillas and their pinto beans. I normally get the kids meal because the regular sized burrito is way too big for me. Their chips are delish...sometimes they need a little salt. If you can make it to dessert then get their churros. They are bomb! Oh and they have a nice little salsa bar with a variety of different salsa and sauces. If you get a soda with your meal then you can get free refills (which is unheard of for a casino!).  Besides burritos they also have street tacos, enchiladas, salads and quesadillas. I have heard fabulous things about their fish tacos. Also, they serve breakfast! OMG their bacon, egg and cheese breakfast burrito is to die for. They don't skimp either, that thing is jam packed with all the goods. Yum yum! Was on the far West side of town and wanted to try something different then the norm. My daughter and I stopped in to grab a bite. I had the Hawaiian Dog and Euro Fries, she had a plain hot dog with ketchup (boring). Anyway I was a little surprised when everything rang up to a little over $25 dollars, but hey like I said not the norm, right? Well the food was really good and tasty and worth it! Check out the pics. I HATE and I do mean HATE going to the dentist. However Dr. Dachs and his team always makes my visit a pleasant one. I always see Dr. Chris who I swear is not old enough to be a dentist, but he does an excellent job. The entire staff from the receptionist to the hygienist, to the Dr's. have all been very wonderful and patient with a wimp like me. They are always honest and upfront about every procedure that I have had or may need which hasn't been much (thank goodness). So if you are looking for a great dentist office, go and check out them out. You will be pleasantly surprised! Servers look you in the eye then ignore you when you are the only customer standing at the bar wanting a drink. Incredibly, egregious customer service. This was the absolute best meal (and cocktails) I've ever had.  Chic atmosphere and great date spot. Do yourself a favor and add this restaurant to your Must Eats!!!  Our server, Brandon gave us the best recommendations and we couldn't have been more pleased with his service.   MUST EATS: Trios of Picos and get the side of Guac. It comes with chips, plantains and arepas ... Chicharrones - my boyfriend said these were the best wings he's ever had! The onions and sauce made the dish!! For entrees, get the Braised Short Rib and Brazilian Beef Tenderloin. We both agree they were phenomenal.   MUST DRINK: Chica-Rita - holy cow - the most amazing drink!!!! Not on the menu, but Brendon also whipped us up a Mezcal Old Fashioned, which was nothing short of perfect. Very good, authentic Malaysian Food.  Ayam Redang was excellent, great service, will be back again.  Roti Canai was not greasy and authentic, loved it. They were very manipulative and literally ripped us off. Don't go there because the price is absolutely not worth the food! The most bland tasting Italian food that I have ever had! Unfortunately, the only good thing was the cappacino. Very over priced as well! The food comes out on basically an assembly line with a salad extremely drenched in dressing. Garlic bread was decent. I was very excited to go to this restaurant and it was a major let down for my family. We had linguine and clams,manicotti,and lasagna. Each dish was equally lackluster. This location does not offer daily specials, but the Maryland Parkway location does. They also don't seem very bright, but the portions seem bigger here than other locations I go to.  They do the Tuesday 99 cent deal for 2 pieces, which is a real bargain.  The regular menu is kinda pricey, so I'm stickin with the Wicked Chicken Basket for $3.99 whenever it's in season.  I miss the Popcorn Chicken special.  I always ask for spicy, and sometimes they mess up and give me regular.  Oh well.  :-P With fresh beer and seafood and service is really good here as they have an upstairs and a downstairs. I find that this location is usually packed; why not be they're so good. Food portions here go by the pound. This restaurant is a really good location for someone who truly loves to eat seafood. I will definitely be going back in the near future. Avoid like the plague. It's a Walmart. Friendly staff, clean, lively.   Long lines. No Wifi in McDonalds. I was a little disappointed in the speed of seating guests. I had an 8:30 reservation and was not seated until 8:45, aside from arriving at 8:15. After being seated, service was not bad. The food was tasty and they give you large portions. I had shrimp alfredo and was pleased. They serve you bread a salad before your entree and they are both delish! After your meal, they also serve cappuccino. It was very tasty. I love the "hole in the wall" ambience and decor. They even have the menu up on the wall lol. Overall it was a nice experience. I came here for a party a few weeks ago so I can't rate this place as a restaurant.   It's a very upscale joint. Bartenders did a good job of quick service. Typically expensif drinks bottle service once specials were over; just about what one would expect.  The decor is modern. Large screens placed through the upstairs lounge. The DJ played some really great hip hop sets; really loved the music. I especially liked the upstairs outdoor patio area. Very cool place to hold a party! Tucked inside the lobby of the Holiday Inn Express next to the PNC Building, Sammy's is a little diner that serves up breakfast and lunch staples for prices that don't break the bank. One of the few downtown breakfast places open on Saturday, I was glad Sammy's was as good as it is convenient. Bacon here is crisp, potatoes are better than Huran St diner and my heart is still true to the people at PJs but this is definitely where you'll find me the next Saturday morning I get a taste for eating breakfast out in the East 4th neighborhood. Went with a party of six the other night and wasn't sure what to expect based on the mixed reviews.  They do not serve individual meals but rather small to medium plates meant for sharing.  I was very nervous about how this would work as we have very adventurous eaters in our group down to a pregnant picky eater.  Our water recommended 2 selections per person.  This ended up being a bit to much food.  The ratio of 1.5 per person would be better.  The food comes out as its ready,not all at once.  Be prepared in advance to share food. We ordered: oysters on the half shell with the siracha lime dressing ( some of our parties first experience-success), a meat and cheese board (jellies were weird-wouldn't order again), chicken wings, roasted chicken, lobster roll, sliders, macaroni and cheese, green beans, steak tartare ( skip), a breakfast dish, mussels and calamari. For the most part our entire table enjoyed all of the food and was very happy.  The rings were perhaps the biggest hit ( they are a little spicy and smokey)  resulting in one member of our party declaring we must perfect our smoking technique in order to do wings like that at home.  The green beans were also a big hit, which is shocking because we were not that excited about ordering beans. Overall we had a great time but it was in part because we were willing to share, work together on a menu selection and have fun. Go with an open mind, good group and you will not be disappointed.  There was some confusion with the beer flights ordered but our waiter (who was excellent) quickly corrected. This place has delicious Montreal style bagels that actually taste like Montreal bagels! The staff is super friendly and the food is great! This is a great steakhouse! We celebrated my birthday here! Started with the calamari which was really good. Didn't expect the twist with the sweet chili sauce. Which it Is tossed in. Ordered the tomahawk ribeye medium plus was PERFECT! Super moist and tender! The best lobster Mac and cheese!! Can't forget about the blueberry lemon drop!! This shopping center has a pretty good store lineup and there are usually some good deals to be found.  Having been to outlet malls in other cities I can say this location is better than most outlets. The location is about 10 minutes from the Strip instead of in the middle of nowhere. It's not a long drive for any local since it's conveniently located near the 215/15.   There are a lot of stores and here and a large variety of store types. I like to come here for work clothing since they have several stores with good prices on dress pants and blouses (Ann Taylor Loft/Van Heusen). The Clark's store is a favorite since that is my primary shoe brand. It's pretty awesome to get a deal on a brand I was already planning to buy. I also love the Harry & David store for gourmet foods.  Look for Starbucks in one of the middle aisles for caffeine. The food options inside are dismal, but there are some okay food options in the parking lot in front of the mall.  This place can get really busy. I find the mall to be pleasant for an hour or two after opening, but just generally miserable after that time. I would recommend planning out which stores you'll visit and setting time limits to get the heck out of Dodge before all hell breaks loose.  The parking lot can be insane. As a local I can say that I hate even driving by here in the middle of the day during my lunch break. Wow, there is a lot happening here. People jaywalking, tourists making crazy lefts onto Warm Springs (just use the LV Blvd. exit!), and just general chaos. I do occasionally come here on my lunch break, but I park in a secret lot to avoid the chaos. No, I'm not telling where that is or how I get there. :) The smell gets me every time!! Just came for the shakes late night but the food is always good! They are always on top of it! Bomb food... Just a tip: not good if you take it home, must eat in the car right away or inside I came here because of the mac n cheese. And yes, it's definitely that good. But I've kept coming back because of the drink specials, old school cocktails, the awesome patio, and happy hour food deals.  The happy hour snacks are priced too good to pass up, but honestly, aren't really that special. I think I've ordered the tofu tacos 20 times and I never even really liked them that much, they're just too cheap to pass up. The tofu bites are okay, too, with spicy wing sauces but nothing too special there. The mac n cheese is amazing, like everyone has said, but it is a recipe for a heart attack and doesn't pair well with a night out drinking.  The cocktails, on the other hand, are crazy good. They have a classic menu with old-school drinks that I've never heard of before. A lot of them are knock-your-socks-off strong and unique, and one drink each day is on special, depending on the day of the week.  So I guess what I'm really saying here is, go to Kelly's for a fun atmosphere and grab a couple crazy drinks on the patio with some mac n cheese and sweet potato fries and you won't be broke or disappointed. I love this place soo much i almost dont want to tell anyone about it...lol such elegance abd class...soo sexy Amazing designs and one of a kind pieces!  If you are looking for a unique timepiece look no further than this company.    The owner Steve Soffa will take your vision and make it a masterpiece and become a lifelong friend during the process! We ordered sisig and they told us it would be ready at 12:30. It was let ready till almost 2 pm and we needed it for a birthday party. The lady at cash didn't even care or apologize and was rude. I'll never go back there When this salon opened, they were great.  Over the past few years, ownership/management changes have really led to a decline.  The pedicures I have had there haven't been very good for a while.  I recently found an older gift certificate I had, so I took it in and the lady (who had not one other customer, by the way, laughed when I asked if I could still use it.  She said that they expire a year after the purchase date (which is not noted anywhere on the gift certificate.)   Any business should always keep a consistent accounting policy.  Gift certificates outstanding should be noted in the event of a sale and still honored if not disclosed with an expiration as this one was not.  I was there to have several services and they lost an additional $60 above the pedicure value of the gift certificate that they should have honored.  I went down the road to my preferred salon. This gas station is really close so i go to it alot. Most of the workers are great friendly people then there is some there that could us a customer service training and learn to be nicer to people but other thrn that great gas station I have used a few different property management companies and never had such a horrible experience as I did with Paramount. I was having an issue with a non-working hot water heater which required a work order. The work order was put in and assigned to a vendor but the vendor cancelled. It was the day off during the time they should have been at my home. I told the vendor that was unprofessional and unacceptable so I would be contacting my property management. I was not rude just direct. I am a manager in one of the largest corporations so I know all about tone and customer service. Before I could call Paramount they called me. She did not let me speak or explain the issue before she advised me that I was rude and had no right to speak to the vendor that way. I tried to tell her I was not rude and she was not on the phone with us so why would she listen to a vendor over her own tenant. She said because I was a liar and she believed them since she had worked with them before. She continued to speak to me like I was not a paying tenant and yell at me like I was causing the issue. I had to remind her it is Paramounts legal obligation to provide water and hot water since I am the tenant. She said she was going to cancel my work order since I was rude and had issues. I am sorry but no matter how rude (which I wasn't) it is the property managements responsibility to make sure this is fixed. This was 3 days now with no hot water. I tried to explain I had just gotten home from the hospital from major surgery but she disregarded any empathy and continued to yell at me over the phone. I advised her I would be letting the Better Business Bureau know and the local housing agency. In the end, my husband ended up calling and her tone was totally different. She made it sound like I was the one who was irrational and upset but of course my husband believed me not her. She was speaking nicely to him until he advised her that he was my husband and he did not appreciate how she spoke to me. She then reverted back to her old self and had an attitude. He advised her that this is not how things work and it is their legal obligation to make sure this gets taken care of in a timely manner. He also stated he was an Army veteran and he gave her respect so she needed to give him respect and return. She continued to be reckless with her words so he ended the call with stating he would report Paramount to everyone he could. A manager and supervisor were asked for multiple times and she stated she was the person to talk to. We found out later that she was neither and was just an administrative assistant apparently on some type of power trip. I would never recommend this property management company because they treat their tenants like trash and have no sense of what customer service really is. Just wanted to do a quick update on previous review.   As I said before I appreciated the amount of knowledge everyone here had and that is why I went back. Every experience I have had at Halo since has been amazing. They are so knowledgeable and willing to answer all my questions and never get frustrated if I ask silly questions or want something reexplained.   The quality of the jewelry, the staff and the business as a whole is amazing and I tell everyone I know to go here. We went to this chain restaurant many people waiting but despite this the wait was not so long the waiters very nice and after seeing and rereading the menu we were ready to order. There was our mistake, we ask to order an appetizer and also the main dish at the same time  Then they brought us the main dinner first and they totally forgot about the appetizer also my husband order as a side order a bake potato which he didn't get it and I need to reorder again to a different server . We were in the area and hopped in for early dinner. Since Mr. h and i were in the mood for tacos we ordered the chicken and fish tacos, along with two drinks (freshly made). The chicken tacos was ok, not great and the fish was better but not awesome. The food tasted very fresh but nothing made me want to come back to have more. Also it cost $27 total and if I were hungry when I came in  would not be satisfied unless I ordered a taco combo with rice.   The service was good and the food was served very quickly. But if I'm going to pay so much, I'd rather go to Kensington Avenue for tacos since it tastes better. Took my Mom here for a game night, and we had a blast!   All games are free and pinball is 50 cents. I consider this to be very reasonable. They have change machines for cash, but we didn't have cash. No ATM...yet. We had to go get cash to play. I don't think this will be an issue anymore once the ATM is available. We went early on a Thursday night and we practically had the place to ourselves. Not the biggest game selection I've seen, but still great. Also have foosball.   Beer selection is decent, even though a few taps were out when we were there. A lot of local offerings. I LOVE the bar is made out of old cassette tapes! We tried the nacho pretzel, and it was a bit of a let down. Needed more salt, more flavor. I'm sure this will all get better as things go.  Overall, I am so pumped to have this place in South End! It is a great break from the usual and a great place to hang out any day of the week. We will be back! The only thing that made me do 4 instead of 5 stars was the food. The Tuna Salad on wheat was okay. Too bad the staff are way more into talking to  each other than being friendly with customers. What can you say about a thrift store? How about it's thrifty, sometimes. Because we live 5 minutes away my wife goes there just about every day. Every now and then she scores a good deal, table cloth, jacket or some other item. It's strictly hit or miss. They do have 50% off sales quite often. Worth checking out if you're in the area. Excellent service. Steve was very accommodating and worked in a tight time frame. Would highly recommend. Been here twice now and loved it! Two of the best mojitos i've ever had. The cocktails are definitely worth ordering. The food, same category. I've tried 4 different dishes off the menu and they were all fantastic. Great service, even when it was super busy. Try it! I've eaten here several times and is one of my favourite restaurants.  The food is delicious and they serve generous portions.  My favourites are the ceasar salad and the linguine with goat cheese and mushrooms. The servers are fast, polite and attentive and the owner is very personable.  He is always present and gives everyone personal attention.  The place is small and you may have to wait a few minutes for a table but it's worth the wait. I can't believe I haven't reviewed Sineglazka! They changed my life. I wasn't able to have a cat for 16 years because our older son has severe cat allergies. When I found out about Siberian breed I googled the local breeders and found Sineglazka. We brought my son over and he had 0 reaction from the cats. I fell in love with Kuzma and not even 1 month later he became a part of our family. He's absolutely perfect: potty trained, well-behaved, doesn't scratch our baby, and is gorgeous to look at. Love! I was brought here by my coworkers. It's become sort of a ritual at my office to bring any new employees or out-of-town visitors here for lunch. Kind of a test of character. We usually go at least once a month.  My typical order is jerk chicken fried rice and egg foo yung with another varying meat option. I've tried the black beans and have to admit they're pretty good but I'm just not a big fan of lentils. I prefer having more rice.  I love the egg foo yung. I dislike a lot of Americanized Chinese food dishes, but egg foo yung is one exception. My parents had a Chinese restaurant when I was younger and the egg foo yung at Chino's tastes just like my dad used to make, right down to the gravy on top.  I finally tried the Chinese BBQ pork a couple weeks ago and it was surprisingly good. Not authentic, but it had a nice flavor. I also like the emerald chicken, jerk chicken, and carnitas. My coworkers swear by the Jade Red Chicken inside a quesadilla. A strange combination, but it's actually really good. I've heard that machaca inside a quesadilla is also good.  Finally, who doesn't love a free snickerdoodle cookie? Just a little update-  The Klondike no longer offers any table games. So no more 10 cent roulette and no more $2 blackjack. This was a huge surprise because the 10 cent roulette was the huge draw of this joint. Without the table games, all you're left with is an extremely run down casino that has such a thick layer of cigarette smoke wafting around that it's like you're walking through a Vegas gambler's fog. I think the only thing that's left are the slot machines... I wouldn't be surprised if they tear this place down and start over from scratch. Might be the best thing. (by the way, I was going to rate this place 4 stars if they still offered the table games, but with those gone, there's nothing left to draw you in) Arrived to spend some time at a bar that looked like it had a decent atmosphere after our flight was cancelled.  However my wife and I were overwhelmed by the number of fruit flies. It was bad just when we were having drinks. When the person next to use ordered some food, it became seriously disgusting. Can't comment on the food because we are going to move on to somewhere else. Any drinks other than beer, don't even bother.  They're extremely watered down. As in nooo alcohol...     Anyways on to the review. $4.95 for everything on the menu EXCEPT DRINKS!  I got the baja shrimp tacos. They were okay. Ask for hot sauce on the side because they are pretty bland.   The tilapia is pretty good so get that.  The burger is good. Get that too.   I was pretty disappointed with the calamari. The rest was missing. We got literally 10 pieces and yeah I know it's $4.95 but damn. Note: This review is strictly based on the food at Fresh and not the juices and such.  First off I'm not a vegetarian but can appreciate a good vegetarian food when I have one and the food at Fresh was VERY bland (yes even for vegetarian food).   I had the dragon bowl with the noodles and the sauce and vegetables and tofu had next to no taste (a little marinade with the grilling would go a long way). There was however some bean wrap (starts with a K) that was pretty tasty but that was pretty much it from the bunch of items we had on the menu.   The place looked alright, but was far too expensive for the sub-par food (my dragon bowl was just $14 for sub-par fast food almost). Not only that but maybe they should've moved the juicer to the back or got someone who knows how to juice considerably haha. The juicer man kept freaking the bejezus out of the whole restaurant everytime he stuck a fruit / vegetable in the juicer and the thing would give out this awful extremely loud noise that would shut the whole place up and it would become awkwardly quiet.  Anyways I give this a 2 stars for expensive sub-par fast food, uninteresting (overdone) design, and food creation tactics. It seems the chain is just trying to catch on to the healthy vegetarian food craze and make as much money as they can while sacrificing originality and good food in the process. The food was OK, but the wait was unbearable. 20 minutes to be seated, 15 minutes to be waited on, 30 minutes for the food to arrive. Hope you have a long layover. The table, chairs and floor was not especially clean either. Here to rent my car, 1 agent 6 people ahead of me. There's no way I'm going to make my first appointment  Would you please learn how to staff a car rental place #1 #2 learn how to staff it on Spring Break Please take advantage car rental off Hotwire  I did not choose you for this trip, nor will I in the future  Pathetic customer service and pathetic for the lack of respect for your employees  Now 6 people behind me 25 min later another employee shows up Id give a 3.5 closer to a 4. Customer service is great, i called in my order and had my bf pick it up. Was very easy to order no issues straight to the point. Also when my bf picked up the food he told me how nice they were which is another plus.  The food is typical western chinese food. The one thing i loved mosy was the chicken balls was actually more chicken then dough. When does that ever happen lol.  We also got fried chicken wings also greasy and yummy . Just what i wanted fresh/crispy. Chicken fried rice was as expected no complaints. Lastly the chilli chicken , which is why i said 3.5 and not 4. It was full of veggies barely any meat. Also was not spicey at all. But i guess its western chinese food and they know we cant handle spice lol For an almost 40 yr old woman, this show was a lot of fun! Very Interactive! Lots of audience participation! Risque' but not slutty and the guys were total hunks! Me and my friend had so much not so clean fun! I like how intimate the venue is so I can have a good look at those six packs :) The VIP seats were definitely worth it! if you are planning a girls night out with a little edge without having to go to those seedy strip clubs, watching Thunder From Down Under is a a definite Must Do! Harrah's is really smoky with about the worst ventilation anywhere.  But the theater has good AC.  Once the show starts, the door closes and this is a true non smoking show.  If you get there early you get the best seats (but have to breathe Harrah's air for a little bit).   This is a terrific show.  Mac has got a self-deprecating style of humor that is great.  Some sexual innuendo, but still family friendly.  It is not a 'kid' show - don't let the fact you don't have kids stop you from seeing this show. His magic is fun.  I was laughing the entire time.   Mac is great with his fans after the show, even for those that didn't buy his magic sets or books.  He's especially great with the kids who come to see his show.   At $30, it is hands down the best deal on the strip.  I can't recommend this enough.  Go see it. My stylist was very nice, and overall I was mostly happy with my experience. I used a Groupon and it wasn't stated there would be an additional fee for color for long hair. They made it up with a conditioning treatment which was great and I appreciate the offer. My stylist knew curly hair when I asked about it which was great because many salons don't and create huge issues. I think my questions made her a bit cautious though as the overall length was left a bit longer than I'd intended. The layers and thinning were done well though. Through no fault of their own they lost power halfway through the session. I chose to leave with my style half done because it felt awkward sitting around to see if it would come on, but they were very nice about it. I was offered something to drink several times. Overall I'd return which is a lot coming from me about a hair salon I don't know what's worse!!! The salesman who LIED to me when I signed my contract for this place or the club kids with no gym etiquette?? Nice equipment even if it's not laid out well! Three year contract can't end soon enough!!!!!!!!!!! Check in and check out was quick and efficient and the shuttle was also very quick. The staff is more than kind and helpful. Yolanda is truly a good soul and should be recognized for caring and kindness The food here is DELICIOUS, FLAVORFUL, over all just SUPERB!!! Management and staff are super friendly. We were originally ignored when we walked in everyone was being helped except us. I was upset and almost walked out. I'm so happy we waited! Once the mix up was cleared management went above and beyond to apologize to us and JoJo our waiter was super attentive and made great recommendations. P.S Steve(manager) you are great!!! Love this place for local Thai!  Great service.  Love the green curry and Mango tilapia .  Spring rolls are good and brown rice! ( just wish it wasn't an upcharge). I travel around and glad to have a local Thai pace. Pumpkin curry is great too! Can you guys get more real on your prices? OMG.  I've gone many times, but only for very specific items, (organic pasta, homeopathic drops, flatbread).    I mean if they closed, I wouldn't cry, cuz they're still Fresh & Easy & Trader Joes - MUCH cheaper.    Seriously, $100 gets your ONE, maybe TWO bags, at most!    I find all their wine way over-priced, to boot.  And their cheeses?! buy a couple little blocks - you could have eaten a full meal out for the cost you just spend on some cheese and crackers.  You guys better get a grip, cuz i do (on my wallet). Originally from NY - I have been looking for a good place for nearly 20 years.  This is some of the best NY pizza I have ever had in AZ.  You know its good when you fold it in half and the orange oil drips off the tip.  yyuummmm....pizza heaven.  I'll be back!! I read the reviews and I am sorry to hear those people had a bad experience.  I work for the owner of an apartment complex in Scottsdale and Rainforest has done an outstanding job on all of our issues.  They are timely, they are much less expensive than our previous vendor, and they have fixed every problem they have been called out for.  I highly recommend them. I can't do Italian food unless it made by my mother, grandmother, or grandfather. All who descend from Sicily. However, this place silences even the most difficult critics. Each dish made with care, the kitchen obviously has a deep respect for this cuisine. And the employees treat you like family. Overall an authentic Italian experience. Went here because my girlfriend loves Greek food. There isn't a whole lot of Greek restaurants in Madison so we thought we'd try this. It did not disappoint, it had a very authentic feel and the food was delicious. If you're looking for Greek food in Madison this is definitely the place to go. I gave this place two chances, both for brunch. Because I really want to like it... BUT Both times the food was too greasy for me to eat, and both times the people I have been with, also did not enjoy their food. This last time one of my friends had to send his food back because it was too salty (the ham) and too greasy (the toast). They were nice about it and did not charge him.   BOTH TIMES I have tried to convey something to the serving staff, in hopes that it gets to the kitchen- that food is greasy  and items are inedible. Twice the staff has cut me off mid-sentence, and responded that "this is how item x is made," - as if customers were not eating at other restaurants (even the same dishes; something basic, like a hash brown!) without this trouble.  Some perspective: paying customers should be able to order food that they can and want to eat, no matter what. Always. Even if it's fried.  It's understood some items on the plate are fried in fat, but the dish should not be unpleasant, revoltingly oily, even if it has a fried component.  The hash browns are literally, round oil sponges. Disgusting.  This is the oiliest brunch in town. Hands down. It's a shame because the space is so beautiful and open.  It feels like maybe in trying to do things in a unique way, they are ruining them... even the simple ones.  I hope it changes! They have organic items. I like that there is an organic produce section with organic veg and fruits. They sell locally grown sprouts. I like the bulk nut dispensers where there are some organic nut choices. They have a large selection of various ethnic foods and a section of Amy's organic frozen foods. They have canned organic beans. The store is big and beautiful. The staff is friendly and helpful. The parking lot is easy. As far as crime goes: I have not seen any. I know that recently a wanted man was across the street and apprehended on East Overlook , but if I didn't know that, I would not have seen it. The feeling is a nice grocery store. Another great meal, got there late so had chopped brisket and sausage with pecan pie to top it off , great meal My iPad Air screen was completely smashed, so I researched screen repairs.  Needless to say, it was very expensive to repair.  I stumbled upon this shop on the internet, I read up on them and they appeared to be a legitimate business.  Eventhough I was nervous to ship out my iPad, I shipped it to them (insurance and signature confirmation). They received it on a Friday, and I got it back the next Friday.   I received my iPad Air back in pristine and like-new condition.  It had been packed nicely and securely upon arrival. Thank you, I am so happy to have my iPad again with a new screen. I really, really want to like this place. 2 minutes from the house, great games for our daughter, and an amazing patio. But man oh man.... it is impossibly slow. Our waiter was great, but the kitchen continues to be a problem. On a Saturday mid-afternoon where it was not packed our food took forever. Beer gone. Waiting. Snacks gone. Waiting.   We really want this to work but now it has been 3 visits and 3 impossibly long waits.  Please pick it up!!! When one thinks of sushi in Northeast Ohio, a place on the border of Parma next to a Subway and a convenience store is not going to come to mind. Thankfully though, the check cashing place is no longer there. As a result I had driven past it many a time without a second thought. A few months ago I figured that I might as well give it a shot.  I'm glad I did, to put it lightly. The service has been attentive each time I have been there, and the decor is nice. What surprised me is that rarely have I seen anyone else eating there. Either I'm there at the wrong times or others have made the same assumption I did. I had miso soup a couple of times while they prepared the sushi, and it is just the right blend of ingredients. I'm a snob when it comes to miso so impressing me with that is a big deal.  As for the star, the sushi, it is made fresh with care and it shows. The $3 happy hour rolls are delicious, and the specialty rolls are even better. The Parma rolls in particular have become my all-time favorite, despite the fact that it is not so much sushi as it is crab on a ball of rice.  After eating here, having sushi at the buffets and other restaurants in the area just isn't the same.  It's a must try if you are in the area, especially on Tuesday or Wednesday since one can easily fill up on two of the $3 basic rolls available on those days. Excellent burger and the best onion strings ever and a glass of wine. Atmosphere is cozy and very clean. Will definitely be back. This is really the tale of two bars.    The positive is that drinks are cheap and the food is pretty good.  I've had few things in my stops there and I haven't been disappointed by food yet.  The wings are fantastic, the sandwhichs are filling, and the sides are tasty.    I go here when i'm waiting my girlfriend to get home from work on mondays and the bartender monday sucks running.  She can't focus on more than one task at once and therefore is constantly flustered which makes for an uncomfortable air in the bar area. I've witnessed one of her meltdowns actually clear a pretty full bar.  Dear owner, this trainwreck is costing you money...you might want to consider upgrading staff.  The times she hasn't been there and a capable staffmember has been working has produced fun experiences.  That said, given the location it is what it is:  a yinzer bar bordering a less than desireable area of town and has everything that comes with it. ALICE WAS AMAZING!!!  I came in with my sister and mother in law shopping for my wedding dress.  I found one that fit perfectly and I felt so beautiful in it!! I couldn't stop smiling!  Alice made the experience so fun and really personalized my visit.  I was so comfortable with her!    I had left to go check out one other dress at another boutique but found myself in LOVE with the dress that at Brilliant Bridal. I came back and tried the dress on with Alice and I cried with happiness.  it was the dress for me!!! I SAID YES TO THE DRESS at Brilliant Bridal. thank you so much Alice for all your help that day! I can't wait for the big day next year March wearing my beautiful dress! I have been here date nights or causal wine sipping numerous times since they have opened not even a month ago.  I'm very impressed with The Sparklings. I waited months and months for it to open and even asked "when are you opening" to a construction worker once :)  It is truly amazing the remodel that was done inside of this building. The inside used to have private hibachi rooms for goodness sake.   The ambiance of the former sushi joint  is now an updated and posh Martha Stewart worthy lounge. Whatever the hell that means, I just made it up. Sounds weird huh? Just look at the pics it's truly lovely. The chandelier that everyone takes pics of and talks about is magical.  The menu is a more causal (Sage like) menu. Modern American Fusion? Who cares about the title. It's just good food.   We have not ordered entrees here YET because we have already had dinner or were on our way to dinner on our visits.   They said that they can accommodate to vegan for us no problem. I look forward to a pasta or a special custom creation. The items that we have had (so far) are very good.  Portobello fries, flat bread, salads....wine, wine, and more wine :)  The service is super accommodating, almost too much service. I guess because they are newer they want to help and help a lot. Lol.  The over-service was only in the dining area. In the lounge the service is perfect.  I truly love the way the did the garage door in the lounge and the way the patio area looks.  I really want to sit in that left hand side back lounge booth with a ton of people. It's really soooo big it could fit 10+++ people. I love it. Their left side dining area private table would make a large gathering super fun.    I will update when we order full entrees and remember to take more pics since we are here soo much.   Just go, it's a marvelous addition to the beautiful SW area. I am proud to be a regular.     Oh and hubby said no I could not redecorate our whole house like the inside of The Sparklings :(((((((;  ;) I read the previous reviews and seriously, what did y'all order?? I have been to Laredo over 6 times in 3 months and have had a very delicious, fresh and hot meal each time. My mom and I have eaten lunch and dinner there during on- and off-peak hours and have consistently good food. She is a very excellent cook herself and would tell the waiter if something was not to her liking. The salsa was perfect each time, with just the right amount of heat and spice, not overwhelmingly tomato-y or salty. In fact, I told the chef (who was leaving for the day) that I came from SF to have his salsa and he prepared a pound of FRESH chips and a pint of my favorite salsa to go, with a thank you note (he did this in less than 5 minutes). I've never had such consistently delicious food, great service, and wonderful dining moments in the area than at Laredo. pretty good...love the burgers and the fries always hit the spot Awesome! Best jerk ever!  In fact, this is probably the best quick lunch spot I've been to in many, many years. This place is super good.  It's mostly a take-away business but either way, you can't go wrong.  Thanks Yelp, for suggesting this place!  Never would have noticed it otherwise. Bakery Wee created our baby shower cake, which was amazing!!!!  The taste was just as great as the looks!!!  Hoping to get our sons birthday cake done as well!! This company has zero respect for the customer and goes out of their way to make sure you never want to purchase from them ever again.  I tried to order a Festool sander from them and it went down from there.  I was initially mislead being told that I could not pre-order a tool and that they would be getting in plenty in a month.  Little did I know that they were taking pre-orders on their 'other' web site.  It happened by luck that I found the link 3 1/2 weeks later and booked my order.  Sadly that placed me beyond the "plenty" that were getting shipped in November and because of the delay, I still have not got my order.  Not to say they didn't bill my credit card for a product that I have not got. (over 4 months now).  To make matters worse, their customer service is to the point of non existent.  I have tried on multiple occasions to try and get even a general date of when I will get my product that I ordered.  I keep getting told SOON.    I found out through Festool Canada that they over booked and over sold what they were allocated.  Festool has told them fulfillement amounts and when product will be shipped out to them, but sadly Atlas will not pass that on to the customer.  I don't know where I stand in their queue for product so I am just left in the dark.    The management is condescending if you try and talk with them.  I'd not trust them to sell me anything as if this is an indication of how they opperate, you might as well throw your cash into a garbage can and light it on fire.  You will get far more enjoyment out of the pretty colours than trying to deal with these jerks. Wow  You better be hungry to eat here  Portions are massive  Will not disappoint  Sit at bar and chat up with friendly bartenders  Bloody Mary a definite try visiting from New Jersey this week and wandered into Hurley's because i love Irish pubs. Went to two other ones in Montreal first and they didn't compare. Rod was a terrific bartender and incredibly friendly. The beer is about $8 a pint but that's worth it for the authentic feel of Ireland! I was in Ireland last year and this place really was like hanging out in Dublin. We were at Hurley's twice this week because we enjoyed it so much the first night. Highly recommend! Very good.  My husband categorized it as "foofy" and, indeed, most of the men looked like they had been dragged there. However, I thought the food was delicious and creative, and almost everything on the menu can be prepared gluten free.  He thought the iced tea was the best he'd ever had.  We strolled down the tracks to the farmers market after lunch and got blackberries, peaches, and a cast iron turtle. I have been coming here for 3 years and I will say the high turnover rate between the doctors and the reception people is ridiculous.  Biggest complaint - not one of the employees acknowledge you. I have to practically sit on the counter for someone to say "can I help u" I continue to come here because I have paid off my service and here is where they take care of it. I don't like the saying "u get what u pay for" I expected 100% better.  If you don't mind being ignored or talked to like you are completely uneducated then this is the place for u!!! Great product of course but that is not the problem.  Cashiers!   Can your hire some?  I've been at this store three different times since thanksgiving and the lines are at least six people deep.   I put down my purchases and left.  I guess I am impatient but i would rather not wait that long.  Get your multi staff on the floor check out devices so that they can ring a customer out! Or add another register at the front. This was a first time walk-in visit....casual atmosphere, you use an iPad to select your dishes, and how many of those dishes you want.  Food came very quickly....BE WARNED.....for a party of four, all of you have to have a la cart/menu, two cannot have a la carte, and two menu.....Owner explained why we could not do this, and he was courteous about it and not rude, Customer Service was very good, attentive.  Food was really good and tasty, this is now one of our go to spots. Huge all you can eat restaurant.  I have gone there many times.  Love the food. Like the grill where you can order your own stir-fry.  good selection of sushi.  very affordable price. Came in here looking for a lively country bar in Vegas, let me say this is not it. The bartenders and staff are very nice. The atmosphere has more of an older crowd, my friend and I were the only ones doing line dancing. We had an okay time. We asked for a special 9$ jar for both of us and received a bill for 50$! We let it go and went on with our night but even the nicest clubs in vegas are not that much! Added bonus everyon starts leaving around 12 and you yourself will have to leave before 1 or youll be bounced out too! A previous garage door company, failed to show up. I found A Authentic in the Foothills Focus. I called and asked them if they installed equipment purchased elsewhere, and they said they did. They were a little higher priced, but at this point, I wanted the thing installed.  It was Saturday morning. The woman said someone would be out between 10a and 11a. At 9:30a, Geoffrey arrived. He couldn't have been nicer. Walked through all the steps. Took the old opener down. Installed the new one. Programmed the remotes and we were up and running in less than 90-minutes.  Great customer service and they did what they promised. I used to work directly across the street from Ferraro so during the work week, I ended up here 3 out of 5 days.  This lead me to utilizing the restaurant as a last minute dinner spot as well.  For lunch, opt for the Griglia con Pollo salad.  I don't know what type of dressing they use but it is light and delicious.  The chicken is juicy, tender and falls apart in your mouth.  And the bread... oh the bread.  Warm, freshly baked bread makes my heart go pitter pat.  The wine list is good and there's a lot of variety so finding a bottle to accompany your dinner is a breeze.  You may find that the wine goes down too well here.  At least, I've found that... on more than one occasion. Bagel was passable but nothing to rave about.   Service was quick.   The place was filthy.  Drink station was a mess. The corners were full of grime.  Where it was critical to be clean it was but still it bugged me. Sunday brunch is amazing! Delicious and vegetarian friendly and great service. Def do the chef's buffet with omelette bar. A bonus: the Chef and the owner greeted everyone, and the owner brought his family for brunch too. Went for my birthday dinner. So yummy! The decor is absolutely amazing. I fell in love, so classy, so chic, perfect for my bday celebration. I wanted pizza and what a good choice it was! We started with the chicken artichoke bruschetta! Excellent. Then had the four cheese pizza adding spinach. Delicious. Then they brought me a yummy dessert  I loved it! Don't think I'll go here again.  You have to push a broken intercom button to get service.  They tell you it will take a few days, but then never call you when to pick up the ashes.  The people were friendly, but service sucks.  I bought the middle grade package where they take a print of the dogs four feet, it was so rushed that its just one big blob (the dog was dead so it wasn't trying to pull its foot away).  It wouldn't even take an extra minute to have had a decent print made, I did pay extra for it. When it comes to the usual Costco deals and weekly road shows, this Costco is fine, but there are two big problems with this store:  1. In the last few months, the sample severs have gotten increasingly cranky and sometimes outright hostile. They have always been rude to my kids, who are generally polite, but today takes the cake. The server CHEWED out my son for touching one sample, then the other. Normally, that would be bad beahvior, but these were fully wrapped chocolates, not some greasy fish stick. The guy -- who was working the CHRISTMAS SECTION --  was so mad, I had to tell my son not to worry about it as we quickly walked away.  About half of the servers at this store are polite enough, but NONE of them EVER SMILE.  2. Even worse than the servers are the patrons, who are horrid creatures reminiscent of goblins from the Hobbit. Here are some examples:  *One time, two elderly women started swearing at each other as they fought for the parking spot I was trying to vacate. One woman, whose husband was driving in circles on the opposite side of the parking lot, literally stood in the spot I left while the other tried to run her over. I wish I was exaggerating, but I had to roll up my windows so the kids couldn't here the exchange of swear words.   *My kids have been shoved out of the way of samples as if they have no right to be there.  *My kids have been rammed with carts by impatient shoppers who don't seem to understand that youngsters can get disorientated by the frenetic nature of that particular store. Heck, the traffic jams near the ready-to-eat chicken area can run 10-15 carts deep.  *I've had customers literally push us out of the way to lay claim to some product or another.  The staff is okay at this store, which I've frequented since 2008, but they don't work as hard at being friendly or helpful compared with other stores I've visited. I don't know what, if anything, they can do about the bad customers, but it seems they should at least be aware that the Scottsdale store is out of control. i've had nothing but bad experiences here. the owner was not very welcoming, never buys any of the clothes i bring in (jcrew, madewell, c.wonder), and always says they're "backed up" with their buys. i've received texts when my "buy" was ready, but when i go back to the store, the ladies behind the counter act like no one has even gone through my items. so, then i wait for 10 minutes while they figure it out. here's a suggestion: get a standard process in place and stop wasting your customers' time.  all of these things wouldn't bother me so much if i didn't see other brands/clothes literally from the early 2000s for sale in the store.  i won't be going back. Staff was friendly, food was good, restaraunt was clean and beautiful !! Simple place,  you could tell they care for it their. I came on a solo-date (treat yoself??) And had a good time, their Thai tea tastes kind of funky but that's about the only complain I have. It wasn't bad just 'off' Our guide recommended this place because of the terrace garden. The garden terrace is quite beautiful with very larg unusual umbrellas that catch rain water. We had the Boreale beer which is a local beer. My favourite was the rouge. The IPA isn't too bad either. We had the calamari and it wasn't the best but good enough. They have patio heaters so it was quite cozy. We live near this Denny's and service has been hit or miss so we normally avoid it. I wanted moons over my hammy so we went to Denny's and my husband even expressed his concern. I should have listened. There was one table with 2 people at it, at 9pm at night, that should have told us everything. We stood up front waiting to be seated, there was no one around to seat us. Then a waitress walked through the back and looked at us, I thought for sure she was coming up front. Wrong. She walked back and forth, didn't acknowledge our presence. Then a manager walked into the same area, looked at us and didn't smile, didn't say I'll be right with you, nothing. He turned around and started talking to the girl about some issue in the kitchen. He completely ignored the fact we were there. At that point we left. We went across the street to Village Inn (full parking lot btw). Imagine when walked in we were greeted and told they would be right with us. The manager saw us and immediately went to try and seat us while he was in the middle of something. I'm done with the Denny's. You have sealed the deal I won't be back and with the way things looked the restaurant sales won't keep you in business either. I will never recommend this place to anyone. I went in for a miscarriage and had to tell EVERYONE I came in contact with over the course of two appointments that I lost the baby after receiving things like "are you excited for the new baby?", "oh good, the test I took were negative" & "you're about this far along so this is what you will see in the ultrasound" (these were not the only comments and it is obvious no one looks at the files for their patients.) When I went to pay for my second appointment the girl tried to get me on the plan for paying for the birth. I had to decline her 4 times. I still received 2 letters in the mail for the plan of birth including pay by dates. Then the last straw was they charged me close to $3000 for the damn plan and other things that I had already paid out of pocket for. Again, I had a miscarriage. My baby died and I am still receiving and expected to pay for something I WILL NOT HAVE. Every letter from them is a reminder of what my family lost and as much progress as we have made in healing this doctors office sets us back. There is no compassion here. If I could give less than one star I would. One of the better chinese restaurants on the strip that are both delish and affordable . I would recommend the fried rice , spicy cucumbers and beef noodles I went here for my bachelorette party last year & was here last weekend with my husband and family. I would say it doesn't feel like a steakhouse, but more like a lounge that serves steak. I did enjoy the ambiance, very Vegas-like with the colorful lighting and the upbeat music. Reservations is a must.   We started with the caviar on creme fraiche & potato pancakes. Yummy.  For our entree we ordered the bone-in ribeye for 2 for $89. It was delicious! The service was excellent & our sommelier did a superb job. Along with the bottle of wine, we spent $200 for the 2 of us. Not bad. Can't wait to try their other dishes. Nice little zoo and free and Could use more parking you can park on the street has 2 hour limit it worked for us the polar bear was  cool to see I would say if you live close to Madison go It's a gas station.   But it has a car wash. For my lazy ass who doesn't want to wash my car by hand, I like stations like this and there's one near my parent's place. Which means, when I visit, I can fill up and wash the bug guts and dust off my ride.   As for the convenience store, I wouldn't know. I haven't set foot in there in all the years this place has been around.   I fill up. Drive thru the wash. And leave. Changed owners and the name. Epic fail! Prices have almost doubled as has the wait time. Highs: Ambience, value, pizza and deserts. This is a genuine Italian grocery and I might shop here during the day when the crowds are smaller. The restaurant meals are cheap for what you get and word is out among the ASU students and young families. Pizza crust was chewy, crispy with just the right amount of char, like a good bread. Cannoli was outstanding, obviously had been freshly filled, as shell was perfectly crunchy and the sweet ricotta center had a nice clean flavor. Lows: Pasta and disorganization.  It was a packed Saturday night and they weren't prepared. The wine glasses and forks ran out. They had a weird ordering system where there were two cash registers, one halfway through the line. When one of the staff would become available they would open the halfway register, which meant that someone who was lucky enough to be there at that moment would get to order early, in effect cutting in front of the rest of us who had been waiting longer. Our ravioli and filled shells came out lukewarm. As Yogi Berra once said, "Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded." I was stationed in Nevada in 2012 and relied heavily on Verizon. Horrible mistake. No service in my dorm or anywhere on that block. I spent $500 on a brand new galaxy s4. After about a year, everything started deteriorating. GPS stopped working, service got worse, and miscellaneous files took up most of the space on my phone.  Verizon's fix? Spend $800 om a new phone. An A1C in the USAF makes about $17k their first year, so a new phone was out of the question. I replaced the antennas and restored service, but then It happened again; this time replacing things didn't work. I haven't been able to use my GPS in 4 years. I can't put anymore files/pics/songs on my phone because I have 20 GBs in random files that can't be erased.  The service is unbearable. I went to San Diego with my girlfriend to visit her family. I had a phone interview because I was a few weeks from separating from the mil. There wasn't any service anywhere. I drove around for 45 mins looking for service. Found it, but something malfunctioned and instead of the call going through as I stared at my phone, a voice mail popped up. I tried calling back, but all the bars dropped to zero. This was a nightmare. Ultimately, I didn't get the job, presumably because I hadn't prepared myself for the interview with better service.  It's gotten to the point where I stay at home all the time incase a company calls about a job. It's the only place in las vegas thag I get signal. I don't even get service in the Verizon store.  Their fix? Get a ne phone. Create a problem. Sell a solution. How come my laptop doesn't malfunction because of its age? I use it more than my phone because it's more reliable. The UAVs we flew had data link systems that rarely, if ever, had to be changed.  I think Verizon raises attenuation on old phones or somehow disrupts service to force users to buy another phone.  Either way, worst service ever. Once I start my new job, we're all getting AT&T. Tiny burger might as well have paid $1 at McDonald's for what I got, Las Vegas has the poorest customer service and quality unless you are on the strip. So sad wish I could get in touch with corporate this is sad AF. So close to California and I'm from Texas and it's way better there. Real ice cream shakes my ass, soft serve and tastes artificial, lying to your customers for sure,tasted like trash just threw it away. Negative 5 is more like it, couldn't pay me to eat here. They come out to our construction site everyday. The food is reliable, tasty, and appropriately priced. What really brings this place over the top is the people who work for them. There are two women who come out to our site on 44th St everyday and they are so sweet and friendly. Couldn't ask for anything more from a food truck. Plus it appears to be solar powered. That is a plus. Out of all the Jersey Mike's locations in Vegas, this is my favorite. I'm always greeted with friendly staff and their Philly cheesesteak sandwich is always on point with fresh ingredients. My husband always orders the #13 and is never disappointed. Anthony is always smiling at the register and Alex does an outstanding job making sandwiches Just got a haircut from Gondola and I am very satisfied and happy with the outcome. Showed the stylist the haircut I wanted and he did it very well. Forgot to ask his name but he is the stylist with shorter hair.  Cheaper than the salon I used to go and I use to pay $50 for just haircut and with Gondola, same satisfaction at a cheaper price. Will definitely come back again.  Giving them 4 stars as stylist keeps on stopping while giving me haircut to pick up the phone since they don't have a receptionist. Love this place!!! Always fast and food is good. Their wonton is always fresh and juicy. This place is better than the one at Midland. Must go for anyone who wants to try authentic HK wonton. Great Ramen spot.  Clean interior and just the right amount of background music.  Staff here is awesome, I saw one of the guys teaching the girls next to me how to use chopsticks.  Menu is tight and straight to the point - RAMEN.  Pork belly is great and the chef flame torches it to give it the perfect char.  Overall, great Ramen, service, and experience. Great dinner and service. Very reasonable menu and I would say one of the only place to eat on water st. Mohammed was extremely helpful and knowledgable.  We had a great experience! I recently moved from Phoenix to Raleigh, NC and I MISS MY DRS OFFICE!!!!!!   This is the most wonderful place to go. You can get ALL of your needs met. They have a Dr and PA's that specialize in hormone and endocrinology issues plus you can go to a GYN and also a PA specializing in mental health issues. It's all here. No more 2, 3 or 4 different places. Dr Mary Montes and her assistant Chelsea are phenomenal. You get a LIVE PERSON when you call! People are NICE! They CARE. They CALL YOU BACK! The best. I would give this office 10 stars if I could. Aimee took our newborn photos and she was wonderful!!  She is so sweet and patient.  She took her time and made us and the baby feel very comfortable.  I highly recommend her services.  Our pictures are beautiful and she really is such a nice person!! :). Thanks Aimee!! Waste of time and money. After arriving in town to visit family we headed to "table" for dinner. I ordered a burger medium well with pepper jack cheese. It arrived well done without cheese.  We had other issues with the 2 of the 4 meals ordered. The waitress was not listening and failed to correctly order one of the fish entrees. 12 bucks for an over cooked burger with a burned slice of cheese was a bit much. Sadly we ended up ordering pizza once we got back to the hotel.  Pretentious, eclectic and disjointed menu coupled with an overpriced and underwhelming food and service.  Enter at your own risk..... I always thought that if you're going to specialize in something, it better be damn good.   I came here with my boyfriend for lunch and we both ordered the rotisserie chicken sandwich. The sandwich had good flavours, however the server suggested that we change the slaw if we don't like horseradish. Really glad that I did because it seemed to make more sense with the slaw that we substituted. We ordered a side of fries as it is not included with the sandwich, and were presented with a hefty bowl of tasty shoestring fries which neither of us could finish.  However, the chicken was really dry. And when I say dry, I mean you need to soak your mouth with water to get some flavour and juice out of it. I always thought that rotisserie chicken was meant to be juicy, but this chicken seriously lacked the juice that you would normally expect.   I think this restaurant has a lot of potential, it's situated in a great neighbourhood, trendy indoors and nice patio that offer a warm welcome with very friendly service. In fact, I would say the service is the only reason that I'm giving it three stars.   If you're going to do chicken, at least learn how to make it right. Today a guys who work in this subway station said me : The Canada speak only English ! He don't no that his country speak English and French (Ottawa, Québec and Montréal 50% speak French) Please how he can have this work? I am French and I know more about his country than this boy!  Bad representation of his country! Been to just about every Thai place in Vegas. Archis is definitely one of the best. Best beef noodle soup in town by far. Spent a month in Thailand and although the name kind of has an american feel, the food is authentic! So good! Do your self a favor and eat here. For the price, one of Vegas' gems. Warning!!! this place recycles rice and food. To my dismay, I observed the waiters pick out some rice parts from the rice bowls and then top it off. Later I saw one table had a leftover, they took it to the back, while they bussed the table and threw everything else away...hmm I wonder who they will serve that to! Avoid pork and clams, their meat is half rotted!!! Roast pork and duck taste ok. Also they do not take credit cards. Just avoid this place. Freaking love this place!! Kyle helped us and gave us samples of whatever we wanted to try. I ended up buying 3 bottles, Local Hottie, The Kitchen Sink, and Sweet Greens and also got a Green Milk shake. We also checked in on Facebook and got a free shot which was really nice, but the shot was super intense! It opened up my sinuses and cleared me right up. I can't remember the name but it had ginger, lemon, and cayenne pepper in it. It burned real good on the way down. Try it! I grade sushi restaurants on 3 factors: - Quality - Excellent. No fishy smell on my food or in the restaurant. Delicious. Rolls were well made and tasty! - Quantity - I walked out STUFFED from eating the $9.99 lunch special. - Price - Can't beat $10 for lunch, especially this much good sushi.  But the takeout side of things was not as good. The teeny tiny salad had wilted lettuce. The takeout version of the Sakana lunch does not include miso soup, although the price is the same, and they did not include chopsticks, napkins, or soy sauce. I could write a review entirely refuting the poor reviews that HuHot has received on Yelp thus far. Instead, I'll focus on what I perceived to be an entirely fun and delicious dining experience.   To start, our waitress brought it to our attention that it was $1 Corona night. Not only that, but HuHot has a pretty decent selection of beers. Win.   As part of your meal, you get your choice of fried rice, white rice, or warm tortillas. Another addition to the all-you-can-eat meal was egg drop soup, which was very tasty.   We ordered crab rangoons for our appetizer - which the waitress said were made in-house - and they were pretty great. Enough so that I was a little bummed that there were only four rangoons to eat between the three of us.   A unique selection of meat, veggies, and noodles makes up the main course. There are recipe cards at your table and as you approach the bar to help you make a decent little dish. If you trust your inner instincts as a cook, you'll do just fine without the cards when it comes to these areas.   Mind your sauces though. This is where things get a little tricky and can really make-or-break your dish. If you don't know your sauces, go with the cards. If you insist on winging it, there is a heat meter above the sauce area to help make sure your food isn't TuHot.   Besides that corny joke, what's there really to complain about here? Our limes were a little on the old side on our first round of Coronas. The mushrooms were running a little low both times I ran through the line. The jalapenos were hotter than Hades.  Minor.  This was an enjoyable experience through and through.  Oh, and you get to watch your cooks try to do tricks with spatulas. What more can you possibly ask for?   This was my second time at HuHot, and I'll be back for more. Well, time to find a new grocery. Maybe Bashas. Ever since Albertsons bought them, service has gone down hill. Not enough check out cashiers and they then get rid of the self check out lanes. What are they thinking. Every other retailer is going this route, Home Depot, Lowes, Wal Mart and even some restaurants have Kiosks on each table. I hope they rethink this marketing strategy. We have plenty of choices in the Valley. Frys and Bashas are just as close. We came here one evening.  We were starving and not feeling like cooking.  I was pretty happy with my food.  I ordered from the menu that's above the cashier.  I can't complain about the portion size, it was a massive box of rice and 2 big meat kebob things.  I'm glad I read Bilal's review, because I asked about the white sauce and they gave it to me.  Also it was $9.99 + tax or something crazy.  I was stuffed!  I wish I could remember what it was called, but I think it was the second from the right and it started with an "S".  (I clearly should have taken a picture) or the menu.  One thing...they said it would be ready in 10 minutes, it took like 20.  I think they think it takes 10 but it doesn't. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. I have been to many hibachis and the menu here was extensive. Not just steak shrimp chicken. They hadn't swordfish, shark, and other exotic stuff. Lots of food. I was stuffed on my $23 swordfish. This surely isn't artisan gelato, but it's tasty and the price is fair.  You can get a large cup with three flavors for under $5, which is pretty reasonable.  Their selection sets them apart.  They have some really interesting flavors, and change up the rotation often.    For those who have only experienced gelato at places such at this, I only wish you could have tried Arlecchino Gelateria before it closed down.  That was the real deal. This review is for the pharmacy in general and my pharmacist, Marc, in particular. Marc is amazing. He really cares about his patients, has great customer service, and always helps me (a grad student) save money on my prescriptions. I know this is so funny to say, but I really am very grateful to have him as my pharmacist. I just recently moved back to Tempe and I am so stoked to be able to visit this pharmacy again regularly. This place one giant adventure in itself.  They have such a nice atmosphere here, it reminds me of all the childhood memories I had of camping with my parents.  They have a bunch of fish tanks in and around the store. They sell just about anything that has to do with nature, camping supplies, 4x4 equipment and even hunting.  I would rather do my shopping here than sports authority any day.  I'm a back woods kinda gal. Grew up enjoying nature, off road vehicles & mud.  Even bought my bf's first gun here for about 500 bucks. LC9 Ruger. Of course now he wants something bigger...  He even got a free shooting session with the purchase. I love the fact they have a rewards club card, he get's offer all the time in the mail. I am currently finishing up an incredible meal. Literally still in the restaurant, but I can't wait to post this. Not because of the food (though that was delish), but because of our server, Clenard.  We came in, sat for maybe ten minutes, when he came over, profusely apologized for our wait, and informed us he'd be getting us bruschetta on the house. Then, as we proceeded to order, he was incredibly attentive and helpful. My friend got around four Arnold palmers, and he kept them coming!! He was cordial, kind and incredibly professional. Then we also received dessert on the house (for a wait that, honestly, was NOT bad). Everyone was wonderful, and I'm sure clenard is a reflection of the entire staff and restaurant.   Because of this amazing server (and, not to forget, an awesome meal of the lamb meatballs and artichoke heart salad) I am set on being a regular here.  I've never leave reviews but because of the quality of service and meal, I must. Thank you! We have a friendly little rabbit that we needed taken care of while we went on an 8-day vacation. There were a few options similar to Springbank Pet Resort, but I am glad we chose this place!  We dropped her off in the morning before our flight. They took us to the "bunny and small animals room" where we were allowed to set up her playpen, litterbox, and toys just the way we have it at home. The woman taking care of the small animals was extremely friendly and I felt good about leaving our bunny in her hands. We provided feeding instructions and they put labels on everything so our bag of food and hay wouldn't get mixed with someone else's.   We picked up our rabbit and she was ready to go for us, in great shape and seemed to be friendlier than when we dropped her off! They did a wonderful job and we will use this place again!  Pros:  -Rabbits are only $12/day (such a deal for piece of mind) -Friendly staff  -Rabbits are kept in their own room away from barking dogs (lower stress). -Rabbit was in a good mood upon pickup and litterbox was cleaned for us. -Vet clinic next door (you can sign a waiver in case of medical emergency)  Cons: -The only con about this place was that the room where the small animals were being kept was not as clean as I think it should have been. When we set up our rabbit, the floors hadn't been mopped in a while and there were rabbit poops on the floor that I had to sweep myself. The breakfast at egg works was amazing and they serve big portions! The potatoes were my favorite and the french toast was excellent! Definitely will be back! Fantastic dishes and service.  The chicken quesadilla may have been the best I've ever had.  If and when I come back to Vegas, I will be back. I got orange basil & Tim got chocolate w/seasalt. My popsicle was good...but his was better! Cant wait to try some of their other flavors! GoodLife member for 3 years now... I personally enjoy the pool the most... I find all the equipment clean and in very good shape but the change rooms a bit scary. Used towels everywhere and the hair is gross. Shower stalls are great but not cleaned often or not as frequent as they need to be. Hair hair hair! I hear the steam room gets cleaned once a day but by the evening hair, oil and creams make the seating and walking gross too. I strongly recommend more attention to the change rooms and this location would be number #1 in Scarborough! From the moment I walked in to the shop the people and service were more than AMAZING and just life saving to this lost puppy! I'm from California and was in Vegas for the weekend with my family, needless to say trip was less than a celebration. Friday night when arriving to our hotel thankfully that's were car gave out. It overheated and just died in the middle of parking lot stopping traffic as it was in the way to parking structure. AAA very quickly arrived  as I explained the situation, towed my car to a parking space. Advice to have it towed to a mechanic first thing in the morning to get it checked; he provided two shops info to contact them in the morning as he knew lots of shops weren't open on the weekends. As soon as I woke up Saturday at 7am, I started calling the shops with no luck since they weren't opening till 8am, finally I got a hold of the closest shop to my hotel and they sadly told me they weren't able to assist me until sometime next week that wasn't doable or an option for me since I only had reservations till Sunday and had to get home by Sunday. So I went down the list of approved AAA shops and got a hold of Imperial Auto & Truck Service and I can't recalled who answered the phone but he was very polite and pleasant and did tell me that I could bring in the car but couldn't guarantee to have it fix today. I walked in the shop like a lost puppy not knowing where to go but as soon as I approach the front desk here came Ariel (my angel) she was so nice and could see my desperation in my face to the point where I broke down crying feeling helpless, she came around and hugged me offering me comfort. She got up to talk to the owner Loren who then came and introduced himself and same as Ariel tried to comfort me introducing me to the whole staff; he said they were gonna take a look at my car and keep me posted. Ariel and Drew the other owner of the shop both kept me updated on the progress of my car. I felt like a fool, I couldn't stop crying, but they all made me feel better even offered me tacos as it was their lunch time and stayed opened past their business hours to make sure I was gonna be driving home Sunday! And I did! Talk about customer service! I can honesty say they are all one happy Family like Drew one of the owners told me that day trying to comfort me.. you guys saved my disaster of birthday weekend, thanks to you guys I was able to enjoy the rest of my weekend with my son and my mom! I only wish you guys were closer because I would definitely be your loyal customer! Thank you again! Harlow's serves up a simple, thin crust pizza that gives you that real authentic Italian feel. They have a limited menu (a handful of pizzas and drinks, no substitutions allowed), but you are bound to get a good pie no matter what. My girlfriend and I got 2 pizzas (the margherita and the bianca), ate both, and left feeling satisfied without being stuffed. The pizza has a great, clean taste while staying light and fresh. The interior is just as fun and bright as the pizzas with a New Mexico feel (cacti and animal skulls with peach painted walls) and has a large front window they keep open when the weather is nice. Definitely stop by when you're looking for a nice light pizza. Service was really poor. May try the King Street one to see if service is better. It was my first time going and I found the waiter serving us rude and ignorant. Will not go back to this restaurant. Great dogs, great drinks, great people!  We have stopped by and grabbed something to eat many times. We have also hired them to cater a company picnic. Have always been very accommodating. They have a selection of: Jumbo Dogs, Mini Dogs, Spicy Dogs, Polish Sausages and Brawts! All of it are great!  They are located in the parking lot at Home Depot. There are two benches there if you choose to eat there. Many customers end up eating there while talking to the workers.  Had one today, and will continue to be a regular customer. Really great place. Went there on the advice of a friend, and now I'm a bit obsessed with Ron himself.   Such a character, and I mean that in the best sense of the word. He does great work, and always goes above and beyond.   Not expensive at all, and your shoes come back looking perfect (actually, more than so). Got two heels replaced, and he even polished them up nicely before giving them back.   So taken with the experience that I wrote about Cecil's on my blog. (http://looksharpsconnie.blogspot.com/2012/05/cecil-shoe-doctor.html) I booked a flight online and although my flight has "cancel or modify" option online, when I click on it, it tells me to call the airline. The wait time, gasp, is 45 minutes.... I have a full time job. I should be able to cancel a flight online. Last time I called them, I waited almost an hour and it turned out they had me call in because they wanted to sell me some promotional credit card. NOT WORTH THE DISCOUNTS! This is good pizza.  I ordered a 12" Palermo Supreme.  The crust was light and crunchy.  They make their own dough.  I was impressed.  Service was great too.  Friendly staff.  I recommend it! I just moved here 2 months ago from California. I was having such a hard time finding a nail salon I was happy with.  I am the pickiest when it comes to my nails. This place was amazing! I love my nails by Angie! She was so detailed. She definitely takes pride in her work.  Thank you! Everyone there is so nice and caring! So glad to finally find a manicurist! Excellent. Here for some drinks and team building. Mainly drinks.  Then Hank showed up.   We was already drunk.  Instantly started hitting on every woman he saw.  The he yelled, "check this out!  I'm going to see how many golfballs I can shove in my mouth!"  It was 7.  He shoved 7golfballs in his big mouth. My girl got the shrimp tacos and enjoyed them alot. They have a wide selection of hot sauces that you can select from yourself. They have fish taco tuesdays! I had a veggie burrito from here a while back and I remember liking it. They have a cool looking tree inside the restautant. The place has a cool vibe to it. So far my experience has been good. Hole in the wall?  Basically there was a hole in the wall. I went in. They put me in a booth. Ordered lasagna. Not bad expensive. Not Italy lasagna but worth the price. All you can drink red or white wine l, Salad, garlic bread and Lasagna for $25.95. Not bad. Heck I would do it again. The food was ok. I like the Miami location better. The atmosphere did not feel young and hip like the Miami location. The fried chicken was pretty tasty. Ate here last night. Good east side spot. Awesome apps. Gourmet poutine and fois gras terrine were very good. Would have given 5 stars but the steak frites were just ok. Decent wine selection and great service & atmosphere. I would recommend it. Randomly stopped in with some colleagues. Had the fish and chips and they were awesome. Fish was battered but not too heavy and the fries were nice and crispy. Ioana was a wonderful server. Thank you for being so polite.  We are locals and decide to come down and do the "tourist" thing and you were amazing. Thanks again, we'll be back. Awesome job and friendly employees!  In the heart of Chinatown one would think the employees would be rude to visitors but it was just the opposite!  Hair stylist took his time and was very detailed (didn't imagine how detailed he would be for 10 bucks). Sandwiches are so good! Pastries are a little heavy.  Lots of food with the combo, worth the price :-) Such A cute place! I came with a friend for brunch and we completely loved it... I had the skirt stake and it was cooked to perfection... Yummy drinks  we'll definitely be back! Fast-Fix of Scottsdale is the place to go for watch batteries and jewelry repair. Very reasonable prices and the batteries are guaranteed for years. Personnel are helpful and friendly especially Matt. Been going here for years and will continue to give them my business. This place has a dang good Philly - which I should hope, since that's their game.  First time I went in the kid taking my order had no clue what he was doing, writing it down on a scrap of cardboard and severely lacking customer service skills.  But the sandwich came out great (and surprisingly, accurate).  Went in a second time a month or two later, and the gal was friendly and helpful - way better experience than the first time.  Again, the sandwich came out fantastic.    I found the prices to be reasonable as well, especially for a little mom-and-pop shop like this.  Definitely worth the stop, and next time I'm craving a Philly, this is where I'm headed. I have never had an experience at a car repair place where the manager was so laid back and out of touch with the customer. I was getting new pads and rotors on my VW and dropped my car off in the morning on a Saturday. When I dropped it off I was told it would be completed that day. I was told they would call me when it's ready and I told them my son would come pick up the car before they closed at 6. At 4:30, I called for an update and I was abruptly told that they would have to call me back. No big deal. Time goes by, no call back. I call again close to 6 and tell them I need to arrange for my son to pick up the car and ask if its ready. They tell me they don't know when its going to be ready? It's 6 Oclock now and you don't know. He keeps telling me he has to call me back. I tell them that it unacceptable since you close at 6 and my son is on his way. He does not tell me they are going to work late nor does he tell me the car won't be ready till Monday. At this point I am fuming at the lack of consideration and communication. I am being inconvenienced now and no answers. The manager was young and inexperienced and way too laid back to deliver bad news to customers. I would of understood if the situation was explained to me and I wasnt continually told they had to call me back.   This after last week I had to take my sons car back there to get the bottom plastic sheath put back on after falling off while driving after getting an oil change.   I will never go to this place again. We went for breakfast yesterday.  There was 4 of us and they offer 4 different vegan breakfast choices so we ordered one of each,  We often employ this strategy so we can try different things. The place seems borderline cheesy to me.  The service was over the top good but the quality of food and coffee not so much.  Of everything we tried the French Toast was the best of the lot!  They had some sort of sweet potato hash brown that was undercooked and the coffee was on par with the quality of a convenience store.  Bottom line - gimmicky place with good service, below average food and lousy coffee.  I will not be returning any time soon. Another disappointing meal in Vegas :(.  We ordered a variety of dishes: har cherng, sui mai, har gow, cha siu bao, etc. Yuck. Not good at all.. (I forgot to take pictures because we were so hungry that we just dug into the food right away.) It didn't taste fresh, and the dumpling skin wasn't very soft. The sui mai looked OLD. I eat dim sum quite frequently and this was nowhere near the standards for dim sum in LA!   The best thing was probably the boiled Chinese broccoli dish (which tastes the same everywhere) and cha siu bao (but I've still had better). Gr.. Eating such horrible dim sum just made me crave better Chinese food in LA.   Service: It was difficult to find a server to refill our drinks and give us our check. However, the workers are friendly and   Note: It's located inside Gold Coast Casino. Some advice? Come early! This place isn't too big and there was a line when we arrived around 12:30pm until we left the restaurant a little before 2. had to listen to this yeehaw cringe birthday song 3 times in 1 hour. trees trees trees The service is good for a very busy Chinese restaurant. They gave you a lot of food for the price. All the food item we ordered are above average. I love the fact that they have revolving door, so that the cold does not come in when people go in and out; and they also have a large waiting area which is really a life safer when you have to wait for 20 min with the deep freeze outside. This was my first time at this restaurant and I was very impressed. This location is inside Mandalay Bay, near the convention center. I came here for brunch with a few friends and they have an unlimited small plates menu for only $35. You can add unlimited mimosas too for $10. Of course, I did the unlimited small plates and mimosas.  I pretty much tried every item on the menu and everything was really good. My favorties were the waffles, breakfast fries, and pigs in a blanket. You might has well order everything off of the menu because it's unlimited! The food comes out as it's made.   The mimosas were really food. They were definitely heavy handed with the champagne. They have a ton of different flavors and seasonal flavors. They have blood orange (my favorite), passion fruit, prickly pear, mango, pomegranate and more! Some of them lacked flavor and just tasted like champagne, but hey, it's unlimited so who cares!   I stayed here for about 3 hours with my friends just eating and drinking. This is now probably one of my favorite brunch spots! We were really excited to try their BBQ after seeing it highlighted on DDD. I'm originally from Kansas City and have a love for great BBQ. The drive from Gilbert took about 40 minutes and I was not disappointed. Mike and Bill took care of me and recommended the chopped beef and collard greens. Both were delicious! I've not had collard greens before and really liked them. Looking forward to the next time I visit this excellent restaurant. Thank you for taking care of me. It started with a long check in, and ended with a sad breakfast of cereal and well past ripe bananas.  In between was an extremely dated building, old furniture, ridiculously slow "free" wi-fi, and missing amenities,   I've stayed at a number of discount hotels, and extended stay facilities.  This was on the lesser end of the spectrum.    The lone positive was the young man at the front desk who was very friendly, meant well, and in spite of zero support, tried his best to work for you. So delicious, all the sauces were so thick and flavorful! Great amount of food for price. And the sit down service was awesome. They even gave us an extra cup of soup and crispy noodles for free for our kids. Love it, we will back. Interesting that this place closed. The one in Jersey where I lived was packed at all times. I can say perhaps it was the youngsters working here with the attitude of not wanting to serve. Walked in and was the only person there and I could see that I was clearly an annoyance. Not just the waitress but even the person behind the counter -I suppose he was the cook? Food was ok but customer Service is probably what caused this location to close. Seriously, the best restaurant I've been to in awhile. My friends had the fried chicken and said it was amazing. I tried the mac and cheese, simply amazing. We're going back before we leave Las Vegas. We used to love this location and always went! We visited tonight and it was pretty messy. Some of the machines were broken, they didn't have any chocolate or peanut butter yogurt, only the ice cream chocolate. The area was overall messy looking and they don't always have the best flavors in stock. Used to love going here and hopefully it gets better! This is the best groomer we have ever been to. We take our two dogs and cat here and will not be going anywhere else again. Our cat can have a bit of an attitude but is never scared or tense when she comes/ goes here, so I am certain that she is treated well by the staff. Our dogs are doodles and we have their feet shaved into poodle feet to cut down on mess in the house. The younger one doesn't love having her feet shaved and other groomers have not been able to shave them because she was difficult, Petsburgh was able to shave her feet with no issues. Overall my dogs always look great, better than anywhere else they have gone - and it has been more reasonably cost than anywhere I've been. They are accommodating with my schedule and even send me text updates. I definitely recommend giving them a try! If you're a guy this is the place to go to get a screwed up haircut. Thank The Lord I always wear a hat cause if the general public saw my haircut they would run away like the Asians run from Godzilla. I never understood why people pay 30-40 bucks for a haircut until I went here. I highly would recommend a Man never go here. First time here and am truly impressed with how good the hamburger was. I like the locations decor and good ol rock and roll background music. Will come again! Nothing like paying $10+ for a container of curly fry bits and pieces and a sandwich where the bun is actually more greasy that the bacon that was on it. Finally, a night spot that doesn't feel like old-Calgary, or drunk and slutty Calgary. I've hit up Commonwealth a couple of times and I'm diggin' the digs. Larger bar upstairs, more clubby atmosphere downstairs or lounge in the front, you've got your pick.  This isn't a spot to come for dinner, no siree. But for nibblets and some yummy bourbon cocktails (me and bourbon are new found friends since last August), colour me sold, Commonwealth is a place I hope to find myself more often.  You'll want to try the apple something cocktail. I can't remember the full name, but it's got ginger in there somewhere and it's AWESOME. The shrimp loaf thing is also quite tasty, as are the spring roll taquito bits and the sliders.  Decor, well, I think you should go have a look for yourself... keep an eye out for the stuffed crows.  Yelp's 30 Day Challenge: 29/30 I personally think you can find better roti in the city. The last time I was there I got the Jamaican pumpkin roti. I felt as though they didn't put enough filling in it and was all roti. The BBQ tofu dish is pretty good. I'm not sure where else you can get bbq tofu like that in the city hence why I am giving them a 3 stars.  If it wasn't for the BBQ tofu I think I'd give it a 2.5 it's not really because of the food but sometimes when I go in the i find the costumer service a bit poor. I also sat down and ate there rather then take it to go asked if I could have a cup of water and they told me they can't give out cups. . I also really didn't like that.  Would I go back there again, maybe it's defiantly not the first thing on my list... Definitely worth parking here, especially if you're traveling over any period of time in Cleveland that involves snow fall (November to like April).  Get in on their member rewards, and they'll send you a card that you can insert and use instead of taking a ticket every time you park.  You can build up free parking with your stays.  If you work for UH, sign up through UH's group rates and it saves you a little bit of money to boot (especially if you stay for an extended period of time).  Perk is that they have complimentary water as your leaving and I won't have to worry about scrapping my car when I come back from a winter trip Saturday night buffet around 9PM.  At 9PM the line to get into the buffet was still pretty insane.  Thank goodness for line pass!  Saturday is their "gourmet" buffet and you get some extras like beef wellington (pretty good) and lamb chops.  There are also selections of venison and prime rib but both were incredibly bad and overcooked or RAW, not rare.  I've never seen snow crab at the B buffet so I'm guessing they were new.  They also had the usual king crab legs but both the king and snow were partially frozen and TINY.  I'm sure if our party had gone earlier, we would have been able to get the bigger, more meaty ones but oh well.  For a first timer, the buffet would be good but coming back to eat again would be really difficult to justify the $40+ price tag.  Even on a comp, I would probably prefer to have an enjoyable more peaceful meal at the CAFE! I was not impressed and the food was fair and I spend a lot of money. The place was very busy and cold. I will not return soon. definitely the best barro's location i've been to!! it's always consistent, clean, pleasant employees with great customer service! they can be crazy busy and still be smiling and attentive. i usually get a veggie pizza, veggie salad or cheesy bread which has all been SUPER bomb! it's nice to go here and watch a football game sometimes to take a break from the busy loud sunday football bars. i miss living in tempe and by this location! no other ones compare. I'm not a vegetarian, in fact I'm more of a meat-etarian... But I would recommend this place to those who like to dine vegetarian..  Mom told me a few of her friends recommended this place, so I guess she wanted to go..  Made a RSVP for Friday night, parking was full and place was packed, so we waited 15 minutes.  Sat down and ordered a few dishes which we accustomed to and also ordered some unfamiliar dishes recommend by Yelp users.  Overall the food was very good. Although I'm not into this type of food, I could tell it was pretty well cooked, props to the kitchen!!   Only complaint is the food came pretty slow considering we came later in the evening and by the time we got seated, the place was half empty..  I personally wouldn't come back here for dinner unless if someone wanted to go or if I had to accommodate vegetarian friends - just because I prefer meat and seafood..   But I would come back to try their dim sum dishes, as they look delicious and I have faith in the kitchen.  Even though it's not my cup of tea, I believe this place deserves 4 stars My first visit here was about 2 months ago. I'm not entirely sure when this place opened but I knew it was fairly new. Either way, I ordered the San Francisco Benedict. The atmosphere and everything seemed great. When my food arrived and I took a bite, I realized I had been given the wrong dish as this one was called the Sandi Benedict and had spinach in it. It wasn't a huge deal to me. I really just wanted avocado, so I let the waitress know I had been given the wrong plate. She said she'd fix it and went to the back. I decided to stop eating as I wasn't sure if they were just bringing avocado or if they were bringing a whole plate out. After about 5 minutes of my boyfriend eating and me waiting, a manager came over and asked if everything was okay. I replied that yes as the waitress said she was handling it. Another 5-10 go by and I hadn't heard anything. I was hungry and now my food was cold so I just started eating it. Finally, the waitress comes out and asks if the manager handled my issue. I told her that I told the manager she was handling it. She ran off to figure it out I guess. I ate my cold food and was very unhappy. The manager came over later and apologized and told me that the waitress hit the wrong item on the tablet and they are so busy with trainees that it was chaotic. She gave me a $13 voucher and did not charge me for my meal. She assured me that it isn't normally like that, so I accepted this and planned to return in the future. I would like to mention that the food was good, but the experience wasn't.  I returned just this last Saturday intending to use the voucher and give them go #2. We had a young male server this time. He was nice and polite. I asked him how their herbal tea is (as that is all it was listed as on menu) and he said he hadn't tried it but knows it's some sort of seasonal harvest blend. I agreed to try it. When he brought it and ran off, I noticed he brought me coffee. I waited for him to come back around. I'm really trying at this point to give this place a chance but it was striking out again already. When he finally returned I clarified that I asked for tea, to which he said he thought I asked for coffee and he said he'd bring the tea. When the tea came, the water in the pot was basically almost room temperature. It was just lukewarm. I was sort of done trying so I just lived with it. I ordered the same thing I intended to have the last time. When the food finally came, my hash browns were nice and hot, but the eggs were again room temperature. Not even the slightest bit warm. I didn't complain. I just ate my cold food and made the decision I won't be returning any time soon. Again, the food is good (Should be at least warm) but my experiences here have not been the best. Maybe I'll give this place a year or so to get things together before returning. I've never been anywhere where I have had back to back not so great experiences. I gave it 2 stars for the food being okay alone. Don't get me wrong....nice place & good shopping. But no place to park!!! Valet has roped off more & more space which sit mostly empty. Or drive in circles searching searching. Kinda shitty to have to park at a place where you are already going in to drop $$$ I don't get the allure of this place. Average food and somewhat overpriced. Service good but not great. Many better restaurant choices in the Montrose area for sure! Great hookah, delicious food ( we tried the chicken Kabob and freshly made bread) , very friendly staff. I will definitely go back when I visit Vegas in the future . My husband ordered a tuna sandwich which was a little on the dry side and the portion could have been bigger with regards to the filling of tuna itself.  Onion soup was fantastic and the cheese was authentic.  I didn't like the cheese melt as there could have been more cheese and avocado was green/bitter.  It's really spicy.  Fries were great. Service is excellent and I'm prepared to give it a few more tries. HORRIBLE. PLEASE DO NOT ORDER WITH THEM. They are extremely unprofessional have very rude customer service and wasted hours and hours of my time. They were unable to deliver the product and refused to take any blame. Awful Awful Awful. Excellent service and extremely rich tasting food, Guy has taken sports bar food to a new level of decadence. I had the Triple T fries and 14-hour Brisket sandwich. The meal was heavily portioned. The truffle oil laden fries were topped with minced garlic, cheese, and cilantro. The brisket was fall apart tender on top of Texas toast, abundantly garnished with cabbage. The mixed fries accompanying the brisket were like hot thick BBQ chips, delicious. Ashley made our experience perfect, attending to our wants and needs, making great suggestions, and patient. My suggestions though are to order margaritas or the ginger mint cocktail to temper the creamy robust and overwhelming at times. Please share because the tastes are to strong to eat the same dish for 30 minutes, mix it up and prepare for large portions. Great customer service and great job every time we've had them out. Broken toilet, moving the hot water heater, funky smell under the sink, etc. Really appreciate having a plumber I trust. Highly recommend and takes credit cards. Very convenient location, in the same plaza as a nail salon, Chinese restaurant, beer distributor and dry cleaner (among others) so you can have the dog groomed and hit a variety of errands. They do a great job, the expanded store has a good selection and we have been groomed by several folks. My only complaint is they call you for your reminder literally as they are closing the day before your groom. A text or email reminder would be better. Pretty reasonable, full groom with hair bow for a 6ish lb short haired schnorkie is $37 plus tax. Wish also they would do evening hours one night a week. Worst food experience ever.  Avoid this place and spend your hard earned money somewhere else. I had an appointment with the lovely Ana Parker last Friday. She is extremely talented and very easy to chat with.  She kept referring to my eye color when discussing possible hair color options which I thought was pretty cool! She gave me a feminine and flattering pixie cut and fresh color with great dimension. I love it and have gotten so many compliments. The salon is very zen-like and chill.  The two receptionists I spoke to were very polite and helpful.  Overall, I had a fabulous experience! I've waited so long in the drive thru line and the worst thing is there was no one even in front of me I've waited 15 minutes just to order my food at the drive thru....and the food tasted like crap. I don't give too many onesies and twosies, but I believe this place merits it on one main level that trumps the modern high ceilings, giant photos of good looking sushi and the staff who get something for effort.   The real issue here on two specific occasions is this; I was attracted by all the ads and photos of their somewhat new Temari offering. It stands for "hand ball" or the like and are rice balls either stuffed, mixed or topped with various ingredient combinations.   In sum it adds up to this; too expensive for the lack of quality ingredients in the 4 balls themselves. The photos are quite misleading and in the case of the crispy lobster balls is virtually faux...where's the beef comes to mind...pretty much lobster rillettes at best.   I think you can read between my overt lines that I was really disappointed times two. We waited twenty minutes and never got served... they sat us down in a booth, and we saw them look at us a couple of times but no one came to our section. We really wanted to try it out but no one even asked us for drinks, this place was almost completely empty . We won't be coming back. We go to Vegas at least twice a year and most often stay at the MGM but have stayed up and down the strip - Encore @ Wynn, Caesar's, Luxor, Planet Hollywood, Flamingo and Palms. This time we decided to stay at THEhotel and without a doubt we have found our Vegas home. Check-in was friendly and helpful. We arrived about 10:30 and they checked our bags so we could go to the pool and then called when our room was ready. Friends had raved about the pool @ Mandalay and they were right. The wave pool and lazy river combo kept our daughter entertained for hours. We ate/drank everyplace by the pool and what we really liked is not only the friendliness of the staff, but how we didn't feel milked for every last penny. Food, drink, lattes and pastries in the morning and dinner at House of Blues were all very reasonable and help to guarantee that we'll be taking the trip back more often. The Junior Suite is more than enough room for our family and that space was helpful so we could relax as a couple and as a family. Bell and valet service was extremely prompt. All in all a great time and it looks like we've found our home in Vegas :) Nice service, reasonable prices, and better/more interesting flavour than the average TO Indian food restaurant.  Was hesitant to try a roti place because I cannot eat wheat; however, they were more than happy to accommodate.    Not a place to take a first date, because the decor is a bit boring. Too bad I can't give 0 stars... It should not take over 30 mins to get food from a fast food joint. The service is incredible unprofessional and the place is Unorganized. Avoid avoid avoid unless u wanna waste 40 mins of Ur life away being ignored and waiting for cold food. Looking for a place to drink and chit-chat in downtown after work. Bar Hop Brewco might be another good choice for you. They offer 36 in-house brewed beers and almost 100 bottle beers. Their yummy snack are only $5-$9. This Bar Hop Location is their 2nd location located on Peter street. Luckily, they have a roof-top patio.  So it will be perfect for a sunny day.  However, we came here when it was still cold  and they haven't opened their patio yet.  It was our first time for this location.  We came late night on Sunday few weeks ago.  It was around 11 pm and it was packed!  No one seemed to want to leave the place early .  We waited for 15-20 mins before we got a chance to sit at a barrel table.  We actually had a barrel table when we got in.  A waiter suggested us to wait at the barrel table close to their bar but two guys who came in after us just walked there and sat right away when they saw it.  Ya..they saw us too but who cares right? They were pretty drunk before they even got in there.  I didn't want to argue with them because I dint think they could understand anything at that time .  So we just stood there and waited for another barrel table.  We ordered beers to start with and waited for almost another half an hour for a real table  that we could sit and eat.  I'm a big eater!   Food  Appetizer  - My luv  "Pan Seared Mushrooms"  It was delicious!  They were roasted with garlic and glazed with  porter  It was a generous portion with a $5 price.  If you love mushroom, you would love it!   - Pork Cracklings   One word "Huge!"  And only $5.  - BBQ Tertilla Chips $5 was worth money for its portion.  It was also good with beers.   Main  - Fried Chicken Sandwich $15.  It was fine for us but nothing was special.  We'd prefer big puffy butter fried chicken sandwich   Atmosphere   - Atmosphere was great and clean. The main floor was decorated with wood and beer barrels.  It was cozy but they have limited seats if they don't open their patio.  Service  -  Understand that its hard to expect a good service in bars.  However, Bar Hop always has a good name on its good service at the original location on King street.  So they catch up on that for this location too.  I saw two waiters running around the bar.  I wasn't sure if they short of staff!?  I hope they have more staff next time we come by.  OVERALL Experience :  We definitely come back! It is very close to my husband's work place  only 2-3 minutes walk. This is the best Chinese Restaurant in Summerlin. The Dim Sum is made fresh on demand. However the menu has all of the traditional Chinese dishes. You must go and try the Dim Sum, Shrimp fried rice, Mongolian Beef, Eggplant, vegetable egg rolls, etc Great service and Outstanding fresh ingredients = a great dining experience  I have to add to this review. Everything is fresh and delicious. You can carry out or eat in. You must try this restaurant Great pub with a wonderful craft beer selection and food.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Also, you can watch App State games here and save the time of driving up to Boone, or elswhere.  Looking forward to attending one of their beer dinners soon. I have to start this by saying my first trip to Doan's was 3.5/4 star material - slow service but friendly, I enjoyed a delicious veg/tofu pho (in a beef broth) and my dining companion ordered a bun with nicely flavored meats and a pretty good spring roll on top - but my second visit made me wonder.  I was out with my sister when we realized we were hungry, and were in the mood to have a beer or glass or wine with dinner, I couldn't remember if Doan's was serving yet so I called while on the road and a woman informed me they do sell beer and wine, but not liquor. Worked for us. My sister is also a vegetarian and although I couldn't remember if I saw a veg section in the menu, we did find one online so we figured we were safe, and then we arrived... First, our waitress informed us they don't serve alcohol yet. Um, okay? After a ridiculous wait to get someones attention to ask if they had a veg menu supplement, we were informed by a waiter that they used to, but have since chucked it. Great. Unfortunately he was unwilling to point us in any direction or give us any veg friendly options. Okay, back to the menu.  I ordered the rocket shrimp and the bun with chik/pork/springrolls (after they informed me they don't serve the banh xeo listed on their menu). My sister ended up ordering the wonton soup with tofu/veg and the tofu/veg pad thai. My food was fine, but for her, she ended up with a plain wonton soup and the seafood pad thai. If it hadn't taken so long to get the first round of food she would have sent it back, and the waitress was very grateful she didn't want to send it back and that she agreed to pick around the seafood and eat the dish. My sister then asked for a few steamed veggies on the sides to supplement the lack of vegetables in her pad thai, the waitress agreed without issue.   Everything seemed okay, though the veggies arrived in a completely different sauce, but when we got the bill I was a little surprised. Not only did we have to pay for the seafood pad thai that we clearly did not order (and all the seafood was left stacked on the side of the plate), we also had to pay for the side of vegetables! seriously?? It was only a few dollars more in the end, but included with the lack of service (in a fairly empty restaurant), there are just better places in town to get great tasting Vietnamese food with better service. Sorry Doan's, maybe next time. We were fans of Flat Top but now like this better because you don't have to wait so long for your food.  You have to stand there while they cook it but for some reason this seems faster than sitting at your table.  They have a wider variety of food and meat than Flat Top also and because they have the two sides of the buffet open with the same choices, you don't feel as rushed with people crowding you.  The kids love it.  We like to get the tortillas and they are a little slow bringing those - they give you only 3 at a time and when the whole group is using them, they don't go very far.    HuHot is really a bargain for kids - I think that it's $5 for all you can eat.  Oh, that's another benefit - you can go up and get more at any time. Great noodle spot! I love the vibe and friendly service. I forgot what the dish is called but I got the beef with vegetables and noodles. It was amazing, after a long day at work and you feeling asian food come here. Decent wait time for food, knowing that it's freshly made noodles made the wait worth it. My dish also came a little soup which was a good pairing. I tried the soup my acquaintance ordered and found it quite salty which was weird because it looked like the same broth that came with my dish. Maybe it was the meat? The environment itself was ok, when it gets busy it's super cramped. I found the main wooden soup spoon way too big for my mouth. I think that spoon was made for Matt Stonie or Kobayashi. Overall good food, good service! On their way to shutting down and I can see why. This place is overpriced even with the 10-30% closeout discounts plus I've never been into a Sports Chalet and had a good customer service experience. The staff always acts like they're way to busy to say hello, smile or help anyone with anything. Not sad to see this place go. Surprised they've been open this long.... I have nothing but good things to say about Jason "Ridiculous" Andrada. I've been doing the sport just as long as he has or maybe around the same time frame. But, he has definitely more competition experience than me. I've seen him fight live at least twice and he is an exciting, good, and a technical fighter.     Anyways, I was in Vegas for a few days and wanted to train Muay Thai somewhere. Dropped in for a day (wish I went everyday when I was there), and his class is very technical, focusing more on technique than cardio. I learned a lot in one day and look forward to coming back next time I'm in Vegas. Highly recommended. I've worked in this mall. I've been kicked out of this mall. I've hung out at this mall. I've shopped at this mall. I have early childhood memories of this mall. Mall mall mall, mall mall... mall.   Yet another Westcor joint... this place has gone through many facelifts and is set to go through yet another soon. I don't really shop here much anymore, but I find it to be very easy to navigate and park at and find exactly what I want.   I get a very nostalgic feeling from this place whenever I go. Usually years go by between visits and I'm always surprised both at seeing the new stores and changes made as well as how much it has stayed the same. Most of my favorite stores have long split the scene. No matter how much things change here or what comes or goes, there's always something for everyone here.   I suppose when I'm 70 if I still live here in the valley, I'll probably start walking around the mall at 5am until it opens... do they still do that? I don't know. Todays Energy Store did a great job on our Solar Installation. Owner Marc Hale and his crew were prompt, did a very clean looking install and cleaned up everything before they left each day. We are very happy with our purchase and they stand behind their product. So if you are tired of your monthly Electric Bill, call Todays Energy and get a quote, you will be glad you did. Great food, service, and ambiance! Cool during the day or night. Definitely recommended! Amazing tacos! Loved the taco chiwas! Would highly recommend. Great customer service too. We went here for Mother's Day brunch. It was a great experience. Not very crowded. We got complimentary flowers. The staff was friendly and the buffet was really good. Overall a good experience. Plus it is close to my parents house. They lack restaurants in this area so I hope this one stays open. Had brunch here with my best friend, had been looking for a weekly bottomless spot for a while and this did not disappoint! Amazing scenery and our waitress Nicole was amazing. Super attentive and sweet, made the entire experience worth while. Will definitely come back and hope she is working! Always a good experience. I've been going for five years. Lots of changes!  But the stylists are consistent!!  I'm on my third stylist for color and cut, and I'm happy. At Christmas gift cards are sold $50--get $10.  I buy several and use them on myself! DO NOT BRING YOUR PET HERE!  Receptionist is rude and talks down upon you. I asked a question about the medication and pricing and she answered me like I should have known those answers.   Medication is OVERPRICED. My cousin was watching over my dogs and needed to take him to the vet. We had to buy my dog eyes drops and felt desperate and bought the eye drops. At my regular vet the eye drops would have been $25 but here they charged $66. Also, a recheck-up should be free at most vets, but they charge a fee here also.  Do your research and take your pets somewhere else. You can save money and talk to someone way more polite then them.   I don't review places often unless I feel the absolute need too. If i can give them a zero star, I would. Very much a "diner," but good good food. Can't wait to sit on the patio in the spring. Don't get me wrong the 1 stars reviews are correct and accurate,  but knowing that in advance and the dirt cheap price made it worth while.  The sheets were clean and and the plumbing works.  As a place to crash for cheap I can recommended it.  If you are bothered by dirty floors and a place that is in almost complete disrepair, then spend much more to stay somewhere else. I stayed here for two nights and was happy. Ok this place is now officially one of my favorite spots in town. Authentic, fast, clean, delicious, affordable and relatively healthy. It's the type joint you're proud to take out of towners to show off Phoenix cuisine. Excellent hotel rooms and great service. The signage is a little confusing since there are multiple routes to all areas of the hotel and casino, but there are always security guards and hotel staff around to ask for directions. Great security as well for hotel guests. This is my first time using UHAUL, the manager at the desk was the best! She really knew how to take care of all of her customers, when I pulled up, she was outside loading a trailer onto a hitch, and she wasn't driving, she had gloves on muscling that trailer around, good for her! When she came in, she was so helpful! She upgraded my truck and threw in some extra's including an extra day. I was dreading going there, but she made it all better. One of the employee's came in & she asked how he wash, he replied that he wasn't doing well. She was genuinely concerned. She really knows how to run a store.   PS... if you need moving supplies they have the best prices! I went to lowe's and spent way more! Enjoy! I'm in love with their vegan pizza...soy sausage, BBQ sauce, and red onions, oh my! My only complaint is the crust...it's not great...sometimes I think it tastes like cardboard (that's why 4 stars and not 5). The toppings definitely make up for it though. I'm not sure what the crust is missing, but I wish it was better (or maybe not because then I'd be ordering pizza more often!!).  We have never been there in person--always gotten delivery. The delivery is fast...usually around 45 minutes. Once they forgot my soy sausage and the replacement pizza was here in 20 minutes. Great service! This is going to be long...I'm sooo satisfied with the customer service my boyfriend and I received from Jesus! Our stroller was bought as a gift online for $560. Now it was online for $399 so I called the Target.com phone number since the stroller was purchased online and asked for a price adjustment. They said I would have to put my stroller back in the box, return it in store or mail it back, & repurchase online to get the credit & they would ship me another stroller. Kind of a hassle but I thought $160+ was worth it. So when I got off work, I look up the stroller online to make sure it's still available and it is NOWHERE to be found on the Target website. I call the online number, spoke to 2 different people and both said I could purchase through the phone at the price I saw online, $399. So I box the stroller back up, drive to my nearest Target, explain to Jesus & what does he do? Dismiss everything I explained, he asks me to login to my registry, scans the stroller box & says, "Whoa! That's a lot of money!" Refunds to a gift card $611.48, scans it again, tells me it's now $279.96. I was like, "okay!" Obviously I wasn't going to argue with that price when I was originally going for the "$399.99" price. Lol He hands me my gift card and tells me, you have a credit of $308.84 left on the gift card. I thank him and we walk out with our stroller. Definitely a big score! I had been dreading the inconvenience of having to wait to get my other stroller in the mail. So walking out with my same stroller was awesome. I went home and set it up again & I also ended up purchasing our baby monitor and glider from the Target website with the credit we received. I could not be happier. :)  About 3 days later, I walked in to return a baby bath tub for store credit. I received 5 for my baby shower so I was looking to see where some had been purchased since I hadn't gotten gift receipts. Once again, Jesus helped me out. Super friendly, super fast, no hassles!   Keep up the good work Jesus! This place is my neighborhood go to for Thai. I've always enjoyed the dinner food over several years, both in restaurant and delivery. I tried their mango smoothie for the first time the other day and I found a new favorite place for those now too. Yay! Good flavor, fast delivery, everything is HOT when it gets here!  Order all the time and have never had a bad experience.  My favorite is the Wonton Soup and House Chow Fun, but don't forget the Crab Rangoon! It could be a great oasis in the middle of the financial district.  The swimming pool area is very nicely decorated with the swimming pool connected between the indoor and outdoor area.    There is no free wifi - not even in the lobby area which is really troubling.  But we figured out a way to connect to the AT&T hot spot so you are lucky if you are AT&T clients.  The issue with Hilton is the fact that the bed is not firm enough.   The walls are pretty thin, we could hear conversations from next door.   Also they are doing constructions around the corner and started drilling at 7 am in the morning, on a Saturday?!?! Didn't get a peaceful sleep because of these factors.  Also be careful with the door - make sure it is shut because our door and also our neighbors door were not closed completely.  Parking during the week is pretty steep but apparently common for the area.   For the weekend it is $21. No issues which is exactly what you want. People were very courteous. So happy with my decision to go to Connie for my hair extensions. I was recommended by my friend who adored it as well. It was quick and she did an amazing job. Highly recommend to anyone thinking about getting extensions. This place is a Quebec chain. The restos are conveniently located, large enough to generally accommodate you whenever you show up. Large plastic menu in the style of American chains, but in French and with an emphasis on foods we dig here in Quebec like moules et frites and smoked meat. The food is average, but if you go for beers and fries during 5a7 you're likely to leave feeling buoyant and ok with your life choices. It's called joie de vivre =) Jessica to the rescue!  I came here after another salon destroyed my hair.  It had been processed 2 times in one week, the 2nd time was an attempt to fix the 1st try, and it looked horrible!  I refused to go back to the other salon and searched for someone well reviewed with good knowledge about color.  I found Jessica and was not disappointed.    I showed her photos of what I wanted originally, told her at this point I just wanted to be comfortable walking out of the house.  Part of my hair was almost blonde, part was almost black, so to give me highlights and even color throughout was going to be hard.  I thought I would need blonde highlights throughout, but she said she could get it closer to the look in the photos.    We went over colors, she gave suggestions and input based on my skin tone. - From that moment on, I felt comfortable.  She was really taking her time. - Asking lots of questions, discussing what would look best and what would be less harsh on my hair. She foiled me up, gave me a conditioning treatment, added a little more color, then cut, dried and styled.  She was very friendly and attentive through the whole process.   I'm so happy, and VERY impressed.  I truly love the color and cut!!    Check out the photo I posted here to get a better idea of how hard of a job it was, and the incredible work she did.  Jessica has a lot of skill!   My hair is not only better than I expected, it is better than I though was possible!  I have finally found my hair stylist in Las Vegas! First time here and the menu is a little overwhelming with so many options! Loved the food, okay coffee, great service. Will definitely be back. Came to this hospital after my was having trouble calming down and wouldn't stop panting. They were so nice and welcoming. Even though I was a walk in I still got back to see the vet within 10 minutes. They explained everything and could not be any nicer. Even after we left they called to check up on my dog. Definitely recommend! I went to the kids doctors office. My daughter really like it. The office and rooms had all different kinds of themes throughout. I think I'm also gonna bring my little brother here too. Our daughter's car broke down en route to Vegas to attend EDC.  AAA took her to Tony and thank goodness. He figured out the problem right away and worked hard to get her car ready a.s.a.p for a reasonable price.  Only she didn't bother to pick it up when she said she would... leaving him struggling to find a safe place for it over the weekend. Was he mad?  No, but he should have been!  Instead, he was concerned about her and made sure her car would be safe.   This is a family run business where they truly care. Lo máximo. Great food, good staff, beautiful owner. One of the best late night bites in Madison. I'm an In-N-Out lover, but the reason I took the time to rate this location was because the service was stellar. Most locations are friendly but this loc the staff went above and beyond. Clean, too! Looking for some incredibly specific and overpriced kitchen gadget? Sur La Table is your best chance of finding it. Whether you need a ceramic ginger grater, a battery-powered pepper mill, or just a new knife, it's probably hiding somewhere in amongst the jumbles of kitchen implements here.  It's lots of fun to browse, but if you're in a hurry, it's best to ask one of the staff to help you find whatever you're looking for--otherwise, you could easily waste a half hour. Luckily, most of the employees seem fairly knowledgable about what's in stock and which fondue pot it's hiding behind. Compared to the Williams Sonoma over at La Place in Beachwood, Sur La Table has a better selection, better prices, and better staff.  Still, I'll generally stop here only if I'm in need of something quickly or just feel like looking around. If you can wait a few days, it's almost always a good bit less expensive to order whatever you need from Amazon or some other online retailer. I am not a BBQ connoisseur but I have eaten at many BBQ places. This is as good as it gets for me. Hands down the best I have ever had in my opinion. The best brisket if you can get some before they run out. This restaurant definitely lives up to the hype and if you asked me one restaurant you should go to in Vegas this would be it. I had heard of the restaurant before on my travels to Montreal, but never got around to it. Montreal for the record is a foodie wonderland.   Although this restaurant is priced high, in Vegas terms I would say it's average. The service, ambiance and location are exceptional and the food couldn't be more perfect. I usually have some sort of critique on what could be better, and this time all I can say is that if they could make the meal never end.   The best way to experience Milos is via their tasting menu. I started with their grilled octopus which is one of the best I've had (other than in Montreal of course). The flavor and texture of their octopus is just right and the portion perfect.   For my main I went with the lobster pasta, which was equally delicious as my starter and equally well executed. If I could eat this dish every day, I would.   Dessert was a baklava walnut cake topped with honey ice cream. Delicious and a perfect ending.   I can see why this restaurant is considered one of the best Mediterranean ones in the world - with locations in London, Athens, New York, Miami, Las Vegas and Montreal. Really great little lunch spot. The BLT is wonderful. Nice atmosphere and good prices. Ru sans turned out to be a chain that exists in a few cities around the country. It's not great but it's not bad either.   There are a number of creative sushi rolls that exist on the menu and have a decent selection of vegan/vegetarian options as well.   We have been here a few times which just shows that the food is good but don't expect it to blow your socks off. If you're looking for a place that serves tasty sushi, has a fun environment this is a good place to check out. But service at times has been slow. Larry was the best! We recently had our wedding this past weekend and everything went perfect. We had a general idea of the colors we wanted for our wedding but Larry made a few suggestions that really made or tuxes stand out. His service was excellent, he comes to you for everything, this was very beneficial as my dad and groomsmen were from out of town. Larry will come to your house for a fitting, drop the tuxes off and pick them up! Also they were much more affordable then the larger stores. We had a few add ons and I think our total was $165.00 per tux. For the ease of dealing with Larry, it was definitely worth it. Do not eat the GF crust if you have Celiac!!! It's definitely not GF. I usually can deal with a little bit of unavoidable contamination but by my reaction their crust DOES actually contain gluten. Be careful. It's also very pricey given the quality of the actual pizza. Definitely a big NO-NO. As a guy I was nervous about my first waxing experience but I was greeted with kindness and was made to feel extra comfortable. The place among walking in does cater to women but men can also get waxed here. I guess not many men manscape but if you need anything done I recommend this place, its clean, quiet and comfortable. Ikea is not just a store, as my fellow Yelper indicated. It is a phenomenon.  Much has been written here and elsewhere about this international mega-chain which specializes in moderately-priced, well-designed contemporary modular (i.e.,assemble-it-yourself) furniture and home accessories. Ikea is exactly what it purports to be, so there is not much I can add to its description.   As I write this post, 28 February 2009, I am having a hard time believing my first experience at the Charlotte location of this Scandinavian retail giant.  It opened only ten days ago, and apparently the circus-attraction atmosphere hasn't worn off yet. Picture this: today was wet, windy, and  foggy. It rained incessantly. Yet, when we approached the Ikea "campus" via North Tryon Street, there were blockaded traffic lanes, a half dozen patrol cars, and not less than a mile of bumper-to-bumper traffic waiting to get into the parking lot. Incredible. It was as if the economic crisis never happened. I was amazed.  The giant store apparently has only one main entrance and exit, much like its big box cousins. That was particularly inconvenient on a day like today, where staying dry was a challenge. Once inside guests were funneled upstairs via escalator to begin their march around the massive showroom. Everyone was encouraged to grab a courtesy tape measure, pencil, and store map on which to make those all-important pre-purchase notations.   The displays were massive, impressive, and incessant. I thought the furnished recreations of a living space that indicated its square footage an especially effective way to illustrate how Ikea furnishings, heavily oriented toward efficiency, work well in small, tight spaces. I had to chuckle ironically however, since many of the living spaces I've seen since moving to Charlotte are anything but small or tight, quite the contrary. But given the current economy, maybe more folks will be downsizing (I'm thinking of multiple-family McMansions with kids using closets as bedrooms- hee hee). At any rate, Ikea certainly knows how to present its information clearly and effectively, and I'm sure they'd gladly do McMansions as well as small urban spaces.  My biggest beef with Ikea, however, is purely personal. For one thing, any store with arrows on the floor indicating the direction I should walk gives me the creeps, regardless of the crowd size. I don't enjoy being herded into a space and then being compelled to move through it in any direction except the one I choose. Second, I am just not a big fan of the whole box store shopping experience, where the sheer space and quantity of stuff outweighs my eye's ability to focus on detail. I feel certain, judging by the size of the crowd, that my opinion represents the minority, but that's just me.   I will give Ikea props in the kitchen and bath design department, where the concept of modularity and space-consciousness works well. It also appears the Ikea staff are well-trained and prepared to help customers with both the design and planning in those areas.   I am sure I will return to Ikea, if for no other reason than I'd like to spend more time trying to focus on the design aspect of its furnishings and accessories. But until the massive crowds and homeland security-like police presence calm down, I will continue to delay my next Ikea shopping experience. Today's tightly-controlled visit reminded me more of a trip to the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport than, say, my last outdoor concert where I saw Radiohead. I will follow the direction of the crowd-police for Radiohead, but not for kitchen cabinets. Not yet, anyway. After 3 emails and 1 phone call-----still unable to setup a appointment  for a free estimate. Amy is not good for your business. Modified my previous review after the store owner's thoughtful response to feedback shared. I respect small business owners that put in effort to follow up to feedback shared. After his note, I have gone back to the business and better understand what their focus areas are.   SUMMARY Cheese & Crackers primarily is an order ahead market. The name 'cheese and crackers' is misleading, as what they offer stretches beyond cheese. You can order a range of things like artisanal cheese trays, cured meats to seafood. The trick is to visit their website and sign up for their mailing list. There, you'll get a better feel for the range of products Cheese & Crackers offers on a weekly basis beyond what you just see in-store.   PROS: - Order Seafood: They have a mailing list to order fresh seafood. Sign up on their website. They bring in fresh, high quality seafood from Canada. I went to a dinner party that served fresh salmon from here - was delightful.  - Catering: They are a great fit for catering, in particular artisanal cheese platters and trays.  - Baguette Sandwiches To Go: They serve sandwiches on baguettes like thinly sliced roast beef. - Cheese Assortment: They have an extensive list of featured cheeses.  CONS:  - They don't offer in-store or to-go cheese plates - only order ahead. I would love to be able to stop by, select 3-4 cheeses, take them home to try that evening.  - They have a few bistro tables, but the store footprint is small thus it isn't really a spot to hang out in-store.  - The sandwiches are only served on baguettes, and the baguettes are really tough on your teeth / hard to bite. Would be nice to offer another bread option for sandwiches, as the sandwiches are very tasty. I stopped in here the other night before a movie, without having done any research or prior yelping, which is very unusual and risky for me! The menu is vast, and prices pretty decent for the area, selection, and ambiance. I had the drunken noodles with beef and a HUGE portion was delivered. Tender wide rice noodles arranged on a bed of fresh veggies, wood ear mushrooms, lettuce, and flavorful beef. Around $13 w/ tax + tip I believe, quite the bargain and provided me with leftovers! Would go back if I was in the area. Please see prior written review. My pictures wouldn't attach and upload. I am just so estastic over how awesome my carpets look!  They are amazing!  Plus the crew is super friendly and easy to work with. So pleased beyond belief. Cute place. Lots of color choices. My nails were shaped and painted nicely, but my nail tech cut me, drew blood and didn't even apologize. He was hurting me when he was cutting the cuticle on one of my toes and when I asked him to stop he didn't... he ended up drawing blood. He then left me with dried blood on my manicure. Gross. I had to go back and ask someone to fix it. They were nice but made me wait and ended up not being able to fix it. They literally let me walk out bleeding and with dried blood on my polished toe, gave me polish to put on it later and let me pay full price for the pleasure. The rest of my nails look nice which I'm appreciative of, but disappointed about a bloody pedicure from a place with all these rave reviews. The next day my whole cuticle looks injured and I'm left with a decent size, gross looking scab. Oh well. I guess I'll just keep looking for a go-to pedi place. Be careful if you go here. Good flavors, good entrees.  Sometimes it's not entirely clear which style a dish is going to be in, which can lead to interesting mishmashes.  Friendly service.  9/10 ... Given what it is. Horrible! No shuttles running. No one at the gate to give directions. I missed my flight because of no service. Cool looking spot inside.  Food is good. Price is right! The French Toast was delicious. I ordered large ice cream in a cup for $6.35 u want decent amount of ice cream... I told the lady at the cash register she said this is it ...the cups are large .... what a waste of money will never step foot in this store again ... notice they didn't even get high ratings in this location... customer service is zero!!!! Oh boy. I love giving proactive reviews but this place has made that hard. Sadly I live nearby writhing in pain having to be so honest. Premium pricing with poor execution. The good - prosecco cold, server kind and considerate. The bad - bills couldn't be separated, pasta with seafood was strangely citrus and unItalian. Pizzas bland, calamari average with a strange paste base. Server did not know menu items to recommend.   Overall - the place has a great setting and almost everyone we know including us find it has been consistently poor value for what you pay.   Needs help.
